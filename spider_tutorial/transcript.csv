,
,at Perkins Palace?,Yeah, that's right.,And you've got two,wildly different environments performing,,are you cautious at all,about playing in the desert?,Cautious?,What does cautious mean?,♪ Break down ♪,♪ Break down ♪,In the early 80's, I,think the rest of the world,saw LA as this brain dead, sun baked,,smoggy sprawl, which it,actually kind of was.,For those of us that grew up here,the early 80's was actually a really vital,
,
,
,and interesting time.,It was a time of,experimentation and rebellion.,In 1982, I was 21 years old.,I had dropped out of college,and I was working for,a municipal bond broker doing phone sales.,I was very involved in the,scene, which was punk rock,,but it was also a lot of really unusual,music and performance.,I was 19, 20 years old.,I was very much into punk rock,and going to shows all the time.,It felt just natural that it,was just a part of our lives,that we would go up to Al's,Bar and go to the Anti-Club,and go to the Whiskey to,see shows all the time.,You could go out every night,of the week, pretty much,,there was live music, three amazing bands.,Raji's, The Whiskey, the Veil.,Hollywood as a scene was really small.,We knew everybody.,If you went to the Whiskey,,you knew everybody in the Whiskey.,If you went to the Starwood,,you knew everybody in the Starwood.,If you went to the Zero after hours,,you knew all those characters.,We were very diverse and,there were just as many,people of color up in it,as there were white kids.,And so bands were multi-cultural,as well as the scene was multi-cultural.,It didn't matter, nobody cared.,Gay, straight, male, female, skinny, fat,,sober, not sober, it didn't matter.,It was about music and art.,And there was a lot of,really creative, unusual things,that were going on.,Not all of it was bands.,There was people like Johanna Went.,Johanna Went was a performance artist,who made these amazing costumes,and she would do these transformations,and probably was most notorious,for throwing a severed,pig's head into the audience,at the Whiskey A Go-Go.,There was also The Screamers,,who was one of the most,celebrated LA punk bands.,They never even put out a record.,They had no guitars.,It was just keyboards and Tomata du Plenty,had this really crazed stage,presence that was captivating.,There was one group that,really stood out to me.,I'm talking about the Minutemen.,To me they were an LA band that was doing,the really kind of interesting,,experimental punk rock,that I appreciated coming out of England.,Bands like Wire that played,really fast, concise,,telegraphic songs and the Minutemen,were even more out there.,It is the individual statement,of a generation of youth,expressing their own rebellion,in their own way in terms,that most outside their world,don't understand.,We saw on the 11 o'clock news,,like punk rock shows, slamdancing,,and teenagers being hurt,and sent to hospital.,Do you know where your,children are tonight?,It was like.,Punkers have been long at odds with police,and confrontations are not new.,It's our aim to let both,sides tell their story,and then let you, the viewer,,decide for your own self.,More than 1,000 fans,paid $8 each to attend.,Most have gotten inside.,150 others crowded the,door, hoping to get inside.,The doors were closed and trouble began.,Youth Brigade was on stage at the time.,Next to them, our producer and cameraman,when the police ordered the shutdown.,The thing with the LAPD was,you had this really rotten,man called Chief Daryl Gates.,Ahh, he was like the Grand Wizard.,And you know who's feeding,and supporting the enemy?,The casual drug user.,He was creepy and he was definitely racist,and didn't like women,and he just didn't like,anybody of color at all.,He didn't like young people.,He didn't like young people having fun.,The police would show up en masse,and you didn't know why, what was going on.,We're at a punk show and seeing the band,and then there's a bunch of police,coming in the door at the Whiskey.,Like, what's up with that?,Is the punk movement,part of the Nazi movement?,No, it's the police,,that's the Nazi movement.,The police is the Nazi movement?,Yeah.,Well the effect of the news media was,that the LAPD freaked out about punk rock,,like it was the second,coming of the Black Panthers,and they were just like, they,were gonna squash that stuff.,It wasn't gonna get a,foothold in their town.,Sometimes they would come in,and run everybody out of there.,Like with their sticks and stuff.,They just seemed like they were,going through the newspaper,and finding band names,that sounded punk rock and,trying to make sure they,didn't happen for some reason.,Police Chief Daryl Gates,did not want us there.,We would come out of the Anti Club,,there would be motorcycle,cops in riot gear.,I remember my friends,coming in from New York,,bands coming in from New York,and they couldn't believe,how we didn't jaywalk in Hollywood.,Because we were given tickets,,we were thrown in jail.,I grew up here, I didn't know any better,than living in a militarized police state.,I didn't expect anything,else, I wasn't enlightened,that you could live in a non police state.,So you just figured out,how to skirt around it.,We did these little skits,where we taunted the police.,Attention all units,,we have a major disturbance,at the Stardust Ballroom,,5612 Sunset Boulevard.,Hey this is unit 47, we got it,,10-four on that.,Hey Frank, is this that,Black Flag group again?,Uh, yeah Joe, 10-four,,Chief Gates is in a real uproar.,What are we waiting for then?,Let's go beat up some of,them damn punk rockers.,So it was broadcast all over on KROQ.,Minutemen, Black Flag,opening for The Ramones,at the Hollywood Palladium.,After that show, everyone was leaving,and I just remember the police coming out,and just chasing after us.,It would've been peaceful,if they hadn't done anything.,The police showed no restraint.,The police were used to beating heads.,The cops always created the riot.,They were definitely the instigators of it.,I was there and I can tell you,there's no way that anybody in the place,did anything to provoke that level of,tactical violence on children.,I went to see Throbbing Gristle,at the Culver City Veterans Auditorium,,which was a place that never had any kind,of cool stuff going on, whatsoever.,Their whole sonic assault,really changed the way,I thought about music,and performance forever.,Soon after that, I met,the promoter of that show,,Michael Sheppard,,and it was then that the,idea of putting on shows,as a form of artistic expression,really gelled in my brain.,So you want to say three then?,Alright, that sounds good,,I'll put you down for three.,Back then, downtown LA was basically,a giant wasteland of abandoned warehouses.,But it was also a place,with a lot of opportunity.,There were a few artists living down here.,The rent was cheap.,And some friends and I moved into,an abandoned warehouse called,the Nate Starkman Building,,when it was about 25 cents a square foot.,Downtown LA in the 80's,,it was just a huge skid row.,There was nothing but a bunch of winos,hanging out on the sidewalk.,And bars like the Hard Rock Cafe, Jack's,,and the King Edward and,all that, marvelous places.,I knew I didn't want to put,on shows in clubs and bars.,I really wanted to find spaces,like downtown warehouse spaces,rehearsal studios by the LA River.,I also thought that by finding,these more remote spaces,,I would stay under the radar of the LAPD.,I wanted to have a name for this entity,that would put on these shows.,I hit upon Desolation Center,because that's how I was,feeling about my environment,at that point in time.,Desolation Center will only,run every other weekend.,This gives us the ability,to offer quality bands.,We book bands on the basis of raw talent,and/or musical integrity,,not drawing power.,Desolation Center is not,a profit making venture.,There will be no guest lists.,Everyone but band members and,Desolation Center volunteers,must pay to get in.,We do not solicit any press coverage,for Desolation Center events.,We feel that local press coverage in music,has become self serving and,upholding of mediocrity.,You'll never see Desolation Center,advertised in the LA Weekly.,The only thing worse,than a cop is a fuck-up.,If you have self-destructive tendencies,,please vent them in Hollywood.,Alcohol brings cops.,We refuse to sell drinks,to a captive audience,at exorbitant prices.,No dancing required.,We would rather shut down,than become a New Wave disco.,When I started putting on my,own shows as Desolation Center,,I had cops show up at every event,and I started thinking, I need to apply,some of the out-of-the-box,punk rock thinking,that people were using to,put out their own records,and start their own zines.,I ended up doing a road,trip with some friends,through Mexico, through the Sonoran Desert,and we were listening to people like Wire,and Savage Republic and,just looking out the window,at the landscape and it sort of struck me,,like wow, why couldn't we put,this kind of really cool music,into this desert environment.,So the first person I talked to,was Bruce Licher from Savage Republic.,When Stuart approached me about doing,a desert show I said,,oh I've got a location,I think could be really,appropriate for this.,I had been doing some filmmaking at UCLA,,some short, experimental films,and I sort of had it in my mind,to create a film that was,like Lawrence of Arabia,meets Eraserhead, so I,took Stuart out there,to see the location and we both agreed,that it would work really well.,It was beautiful, it was,close enough to Los Angeles,that we logistically could do it in a day.,Then the next person,I talked to was D. Boon,from the Minutemen, because,I had already done shows,,I was a huge Minutemen fan.,I was like, do you guys wanna,play a show in the desert,with Savage Republic?,We made up a flyer saying here's the show,,send us money if you wanna go to the show.,There really was no show,,there was a concept for a show.,And all of a sudden about 170, 166 people,sent us $12, I think then,we sat down and said,,how do we do this?,How do you have a show,where there's no gate,,where there's no door.,How do you get people,there and get them to pay,and even get them there?,I kind of thought, well, if,we include the transportation,,then we have a little bit,more control of the situation.,And at the same time, it also lended,a little bit more of a mystery to it,we actually didn't disclose the location.,So people had to kind of trust us,,just get on this bus in downtown LA,and take it all the way out,for a couple hours drive out to the desert.,One of the main things,that I was interested,in doing at that time was,creating artwork with a function.,Stuart asked me to make the,tickets for Mojave Exodus.,Having this ticket, this object,,made it more real for people.,It was always very prestigious,if Bruce would agree to,print up your shindig.,And he was really good at a printing press.,He's like Benjamin Franklin of our scene.,I remember feeling like,I was in Willy Wonka,,and I had gotten the golden ticket.,It was morning when we got together,,which was unusual because all of the shows,were late at night, so seeing,people in the light of day,was a whole different experience.,Seeing those school buses,,I felt like we were going on a field trip,,like it was a punk rock field trip,and getting on the buses and,kind of not really knowing,what it was gonna be like.,We associate school buses,with going to the museum,with your class, but instead,you're going out to the desert,and you're gonna see this amazing music.,So the school buses were definitely part,of the whole Desolation Center,concept from the beginning.,I was bus monitor, that was my job.,I didn't know what to expect,,but it became this big responsibility.,The bus drivers had just come from church,so I just announced,,everyone, keep your drugs,and your alcohol below,the line of the window.,We all had to go to the bathroom,by the time we hit the,truck stop in Ontario.,We all just wanted to go to the bathroom,,but they locked the door on us,and they said, they came on,buses, they came on buses,,oh my God!,Dozens and dozens just,pouring out of these buses,,the green-haired, leather-jacketed,,strange looking youth of,LA out on their day trip.,We had a plan as to when,people were going to show up,,but I'm out there with my,stuff and until I saw a couple,of cars showing up and then,these buses on the horizon,,it was like, I was like, okay,,so I guess this is gonna happen.,We got out of the bus and the lid was off,,it was in the wide open.,Being out in the desert was a,really new experience for me.,I was a kid from East LA, I,was barely out of high school.,I remember being struck,by just how dusty it was,and truly desolate.,That might've been my first,time to the desert, actually,,because my parents didn't really take us,on family trips to the desert.,Not being that far away in Pedro,,we didn't know a lot about the desert.,Me and D. Boon, this was really new for us.,Then we felt kind of stupid,after for not knowing about,it and it's California.,Here we are in,the godforsaken Mojave Desert.,In a fuckin' riverbed.,Let's get into some music.,So it was blowing really hard,,so hard D. Boon, because he wore contacts,,had to wear sunglasses up really close,and then a headband to try to seal it up,and not let these little grains in,,because it was driving him crazy.,The wind is blowing into the microphones,and we put socks on them,,I think literally socks.,I had the buses pull up behind the band,and form a windbreak behind the band,and the sound system,was going with the wind.,Are you ready Mister Soundman?,Yes sir, band.,Okay, here we go.,It wasn't exactly how I had pictured it,because I liked the idea of setting up,and playing with this beautiful backdrop,and here, the audience was,looking at the band playing,and the buses were like five feet away.,But you could just turn around,and look in any other direction.,Once Savage Republic started playing,,the sound was almost,bouncing off the desert floor,and I just remember thinking this,was one of the coolest things,I'll ever do in my whole life.,The uniqueness of being in an open space,out in the desert definitely,added a magical element.,I know that sounds corny,,but it really felt like,we were these young,people creating some great,alternative world for,ourselves out in the desert.,There was no violence and no weirdness,everybody was in this one cool group.,We were really focused and bonded.,It meant a lot to us.,Later on we talk about, what are the things,that all these years together we've done,that's been important,and and it really defined,who we were as a couple.,It was transformative.,That desert environment with desert spirits,is awesome for acts of freedom.,It was just this beautiful,,mythical-almost experience.,We didn't make any money on it.,The bands got paid, we paid the sound guy,who brought a generator out.,It seemed like yeah,,we were made to be here.,This gig makes total sense.,And also the idea of the bus,,having it all self-contained.,You bring it out, the PA,,even though the generator,wasn't big enough, we,were on the right track.,But the whole thing where you,could totally make it happen yourself.,It was really beyond the,theory, it was made real.,I really felt a sense of accomplishment,,it was almost like we pulled off a raid,or something like that.,It all worked out.,We got there, the bands played,,everybody got back on the bus.,The buses eventually made it back to LA,and now I need to figure,out what other interesting,experiences are possible.,After I did the desert show,with Savage Republic and the Minutemen,,I quit my job and I was,backpacking in Europe,and Berlin is where I ended up.,I had a few phone numbers,,a few people to look up.,This is the notebook,that I had in those days.,It's how I found people's phone numbers,or if I met them I wrote down numbers,and followed up with them.,I had different cities,,different countries.,Berlin in the early 80's,,did feel quite, you could,use the term apocalyptic.,It did feel like the end of civilization,could not be that far away.,The early 80's was a time,when Cold War was still on.,If there was a nuclear conflict,,you'd be among the first to go, really.,We were in West Berlin, was right within,what was then the Communist,part of the world.,You did have this island feeling,of being surrounded by the,East German DDR republic.,You still had bullet holes and the remnants,of World War II on the walls.,There was so much history here,,even though it was a difficult,place to be at that time,,I did like it here.,For me, this was an inspiring place to be.,I would stay in squats,,so I felt like even though the environments,were very different, there,was a lot of connections,creatively between people,doing similar types of music,and art in Los Angeles and San Francisco.,The people that were here,had a similar sensibility.,It was kind of like, let's,not just stop with punk rock,,how can we express these,ideas in other ways?,I sort of saw another approach to life,that was less focused on a nine to five job,and more about what you,were doing with your life,,so I kind of wanted to keep,that going in some way.,Before I came here in Los Angeles,,I had a friend that wrote,down Collapsing New Buildings,,go see them.,And then eventually they,did play at this club,and it just lived up to,everything I had heard,they were just so intense,and really different.,When I saw them I was kind of in awe,of what I'd just seen.,I liked that they were,playing metal percussion,and not conventional instruments.,And I thought, I don't know,what this would be like,if we took it into the,middle of the desert.,And so I just threw it out there,,like hey, maybe this could happen.,Einstürzende Neubauten were in New York,and one of them called me up and said,we're gonna be in Los Angeles in two weeks,,can you do a desert show?,So that was really,exciting, a big challenge,,and at the same time, really scary,,because I really didn't know,if I could pull it together that fast,with a bigger band from out of town.,Bruce from Savage Republic,,he and I decided we were,gonna scout a new location.,And this was not the most,really well thought out process,,but there's a small town way,east even of Palm Springs,out in the desert called Mecca.,So we thought, oh it's,Mecca, that's so cool.,It's in the middle of the,desert and it's Mecca,,we'll go there.,So we drove out there and,then we got to a point,where there was a closed road sign,and it went into this canyon.,We thought, well, hey,,road's closed, nobody's gonna,come interrupt this show, this'll be great.,An inspiration for the whole idea,of putting on these concerts in the desert,was a Werner Herzog film,that I saw at the time,called Fitzcarraldo.,Fitzcarraldo.,It was a whole epic thing about,the Klaus Kinski character,bringing this steamboat through the Amazon,,but the whole idea was he wanted to build,an opera in the jungle.,And by the end of the film,,everything has gone wrong,and all he has left is,an opera singer on a boat,floating down the Amazon,,but he was thrilled.,He's like, that's my opera in the jungle.,So that was kind of in,my mind the whole time,,the idea of this opera in the jungle,but instead it was like,industrial music in the desert.,The people from Einstürzende,Neubauten reached out,to other people to participate in the show.,And one of the people that they invited,was Mark Pauline from Survival,Research Laboratories.,Work of 30 year old, San Francisco artist,Mark Pauline, reflects,the turmoil of the city.,Mark Pauline invented this whole genre.,He not only made these,huge, warlike machines,that are also poetic.,He found these sketchy environments,under freeways to do these shows,and then he dared to have,the loudest shows on earth.,In one experiment with rocket fuel,,Mark Pauline blew off all,but one of the fingers,of his own right hand.,Everything that I found,really exciting and challenging,in art and music at the time,,All being here in this remote spot.,It just seemed like, how,could it not be awesome?,but at the same time, how,many things could go wrong?,Just want to get away from,LA and see Einsturzende again.,I saw them last night.,How was the show?,Oh they almost burned down Perkins Palace.,That's good,,the fire marshal going a little nuts.,Yeah well they lit the,fire on stage with gasoline,,ran around on stage with,gas and set it on fire.,It was great.,You know Mark Pauline has been,added to the show and Boyd Rice,has been added to the show.,That's why we're going.,Excellent, we're scared.,I'm extremely scared.,There's no medical service out there,for a couple miles. - Yeah.,Rumor has it he's going to blow up hills.,Part of the fun of this event to me,was really not knowing where we were going,it was part of the whole,secret nature of it.,And there was no talk of like sunscreen,or bringing water or bringing shade.,Probably most people had,leather jackets and their Docs.,And here we all are getting on the bus,to go to the desert without,any kind of like, oh,am I going to be comfortable,or am I gonna be safe?,Nobody's bringing any drugs, are they?,These were full-sized yellow school buses,with the green seats so this,was a totally bizarre vibe.,We're vegetarian so we can only eat fries.,One, two three.,- We hate McDonald's.,- We hate McDonald's.,Me too.,As the bus kept going and going and going,,it just seemed to get,more and more exciting,because we didn't know where we were going,and we didn't know what we were gonna face,once we got there.,I mean, we knew bands were gonna play,but we didn't know how,bands were gonna play.,When you were leaving Los Angeles,and going out to this,location, do you have a--,I don't even know how I got there.,Well the buses got to a dirt road,and then the journey continues.,There was that weird sinking feeling,where you're like, we're,really isolated here.,We just showed up at this miraculous place.,People on that bus were carrying firearms,and all kinds of things.,We were free to do whatever we wanted.,I thought it was a great thing to have it,out in nature with the,desert as the backdrop.,It was like you were in,your own little universe.,At first I was like, I don't,wanna go out to the desert,,I don't want sun.,I want to go to dark,clubs and stuff like that.,It was like, oh God.,But once I got out there I was like,,wow, there's rocks and,shit, I can do crazy things!,In a spot like this, you can reach,a much higher level of concentration,and a much higher level of communication,between the performer and the audience,because there is less distractions.,We're not gonna be standing on a stage,performing for people.,The whole environment is gonna be our stage,and we're gonna be using that.,We stepped off the bus and,there was this stone ridge,,silhouetted against it were,percussionists banging away.,And it was like this,strange welcoming committee.,The sound was ringing through the desert.,Wait, did you guys have permits for that?,No.,I just thought it would,be really interesting,to do some site specific performance,to create something that was,inspired by where we were.,And we have had a bit,of concern about other,performers who are going to be doing things,that may possibly be destructive.,Mark Pauline will be performing,,I understand, is that true?,Now his performance is thoroughly,destructive in nature.,I do remember at that time I was working on,my radio controlled tank,and I desperately wanted,to bring it along with us and we loaded it,into an Oldsmobile 98.,Mark, Eric, myself and Monte Cazazza,in the Oldsmobile, a tank in the trunk.,We left in the middle of,the night at some point.,Going up onto the freeway,,the first sort of bump that we hit,,the car bottomed out and,everybody looked at me,like, Matt, we gotta take,the tank out of the car.,We're not gonna make it.,We had Werner's 10 barrel 12 gauge shotgun.,We had a lot of materials to,make pyrotechnic devices with,,you know, basically bombs.,So we got down there, we just started,looking around to see what we could do.,When we came down there,and we got out to the desert,I was like, well, look at,all this fucking garbage,people bring out here.,I said we'll make totem,poles with all the garbage,and all the refrigerators,,put bombs in all those,,Werner can shoot at the,refrigerators and shit.,We'll set bombs up in the mountains.,We'll try to knock a couple rocks down.,The people in Djemaa-El-Fina,were hoping that the,nature, the environment here,would be left as it was,and this is kind of opposed,to that idea, what do you think about that?,Well first thought that comes to my mind,is that nature, we're part of nature,,and also that nature itself is.,Well, my blood.,The first bomb we set off,to just let people know,the show was starting,was in this cave about 100,yards away from where we were.,And I had put a metal plate,over it and it blew up,and I was like damn,,that was a big explosion,because it kind of,funneled the shockwave out,and I figured that would,get everyone's attention.,Well, it also folded this,three foot by three foot,sheet of steel in half and sent,it flying over the audience,at about 200 miles an hour,,spinning like a frisbee,about 10 feet up off the ground.,I looked up and just saw it overhead,and I was like, ugh, okay.,Something blew up here,and then just projectile,,over the crowd and everyone got,a bit panicky and terrified.,Some people were just super happy,because it was like, yes, total anarchy,,like create anarchy, make it happen now.,And then I just asked is everybody okay,and someone said it landed,past where everybody was,it was like okay, let's do this show,because we were gonna stop the show,if somebody got cut in half, obviously.,What he did in the desert was incredible.,That was mind blowing, fantastic.,In Europe, you don't really have the access,to explosives and weapons in,the same way Americans do.,You did not have permits for those spaces,and that was, I think, the,most empowering thing about it,and the boldest thing.,Okay, ladies and gentlemen,,I'm going to make a real,important announcement right now,so I'd like everybody's,undivided attention.,Just for a moment.,They're gonna blow that,side of the mountain away.,When Mark Pauline was,trying to blow up the boulder,,there were some people that,were really upset about that,because it was like he's,blowing up the desert.,I was like, oh, you shouldn't,be hurting the mountain.,I did feel that way.,But there was another,part of me that was like,oh, this is kind of great.,So it just went bang,,but then nothing moved.,The desert won anyway,,he was never able to blow up the boulder.,So nature beat him in the long run.,I was kind of hoping to see the hillside,come down on everybody.,But that's my disappointment.,People in their 20's are sociopaths.,All of them.,If someone did that now, you'd,just be on Facebook going,,what a bunch of fucking assholes,,who are these douchebag hipsters,,they have no fucking respect!,And like, yeah, we did that.,We're just like, yeah!,I immediately understood,why they are called,Survival Research Laboratories,and how much the element of danger,and the element of feeling,alive are actually connected.,That's an existential thing,you learned in West Berlin.,From the times of radical demonstrations,and radical politics,,you noticed a connection,between danger and the,feeling of being alive.,I understood that immediately.,Boyd Rice,,getting ready to perform here real soon,,do you think you're gonna get anything,off the environment here?,I don't know.,I'm thinking it might be,some place it would reflect,a lot of sound but I don't,know if it will or not.,Boyd Rice was one of,the most original people,I'd ever met in my life.,Boyd was kind of a wildcard.,Very spontaneous, I don't think he was very,what I would call overcalculating.,Boyd asked me if would be his assistant,in this fakir-like performance,that he was planning to do.,For a long time I'd,thought of doing this thing,,like this old Sufi trick where they have,like a cinder block on your stomach,and somebody smashes,it with a sledgehammer.,And I thought, it would be,good to open a show that way,,and have somebody smash,this thing on my stomach,and then put all the sound over the rhythm.,There was such a weird sound,,we were like, what is that noise?,and it was like, look, there's,mics on the cinder blocks.,And of course, the eye contact that we had,,because he would signal to,me without saying anything,,whether he thought I,could hit a little harder,or whether I had reached the intensity,that he can deal with.,If you totally relax,,the cinder block absorbs,most of the impact and you aren't hurt.,The sun was just going down,behind the mountian rocks,and I remember they started the generator.,The incredible noise from,Neubauten at that point just hit.,And I was lying in the,dirt, like front row,,lying on my stomach in the dirt.,They were giving a pretty hard time,to our Dad's power tools.,They borrowed a chainsaw,and a circular saw,,which was fine, I just,said don't ruin them,,and they ruined them.,I'm in construction, I've,always done that type of work,,pouring concrete, banging this together,and breaking rocks, whatever,,and that stuff really moved me,because it was solid steel grinding,,just real crude shit that really,viscerally got you inside.,It was riveting.,How can people say that it's not music?,I had my set of sticks I would play with,but that got all lost in the sand.,The only possibility for me to make music,or make noise with rocks,that we found in the sand,and the metal plate.,You really have to react to,what the stones are doing,they fight back and that's,a very organic thing.,Blixa almost seemed like a,shaman, you know what I mean,,and there was that feeling,of shared experience,and there was that feeling,of almost a trance-like state,that you could get into.,And I just remember,Blixa, just staring at me,and shattering these feelings,of my Dad or whatever,that came bubbling up.,I'd never been affected,like that at a show.,The fact that people are,willing to put this energy,into witnessing what you are doing there,is actually creating a possible,environment of reflection.,These people think they see something,but what they see or what,they hear is themselves.,I had been estranged from my parents.,They thought that I had,lost my mind or something,so after this Neubauten show,I sat down and wrote a letter.,10 pages of the entire experience,and said I'm not the same,child that left home.,And this why, and I hope,you understand this,,sealed it up and sent it to my mother.,She was just amazed,and she says, that's an incredible story,,that really happened?,I kind of understand now why you love this.,It was a religious experience.,From someone who rejects all religion,,it was a religious experience.,After doing two desert shows,,it started to feel a little bit repetitive.,I felt like I needed to something else,to take the Desolation Center concept,and put this music into,another environment.,So I started thinking about,,what's the opposite of desert?,Water.,So that lead me to think,about the Minutemen,because I had already done,shows with the Minutemen.,We were friends and I knew that they were,from here in San Pedro,and I used to come down,here for backyard parties,where the Minutemen would be,playing and on the way back,home up the 110 freeway I,would see the cranes and,harbor all lit up at night,and it just fascinated me.,I was really interested in this whole area,that was such a big part,of Southern California,,but not the cliche of,the beach or Hollywood.,I thought, how cool would,it be to do a show here?,First off, just having a Pedro gig,,we were way into it because,it was very difficult,in those days for us to play our own town.,We were stopped many times,,I can't even tell you,how few gigs we had where,we played all the way.,I mean there were some,keggers in backyards.,It was really tough for,us to play our own town.,There was a lot of friction with people,over these assumptions about,what all this stuff was about.,Funny names, funny clothes,,funny songs, funny music.,People really took it as threats.,The Minutemen were a San Pedro band.,They were not an LA punk rock band.,They identified themselves with that city.,San Pedro is a working class town,,these were a bunch of totally down home,,for real, unmannered guys.,This was the Catalina terminal.,Where these boats are,now, it's much smaller.,Right there, that's Princess Cruises.,That's one of their boats in fact.,That's where the Love,Boat did their bullshit.,Me and D. Boon, we ran,the parking lot there.,This was in the late 70's.,First we worked together at,Jack in the Box on Sixth Street,,you pass it on Gaffey.,$1.65 an hour, we did,graveyard there, 11 to seven.,D. Boon was sensitive man, an artist man,,a painter with the guitar.,So when your mothers,and fathers create forums,in which your children can,learn the beauty of the world,through the arts so they can,pass it on to their children.,That's what my parents did for me.,Make Art not Bombs.,So I took this idea of doing,a Minutemen show on a boat,in the harbor to D. Boon,,Mike Watt and George,and they were really excited about it.,And they were like, ""Hey, we,can get the Meat Puppets."",And I was like, wow, that would be amazing.,The Meat Puppets started,out as this demented,,chaotic thrash band from Phoenix, Arizona,that had somehow emerged,as some of the most,skilled musicians on the scene.,Part of the Desolation,Center concept was to,take this music and put,it into environments,where you don't usually see music,and really be able to experience,other parts of the landscape in a new way.,The big challenge was, how do,you find a boat in the harbor,that's willing to let pack,hundreds of punk rockers,onto this boat and take,it around the harbor.,Finally I found a whale,watch boat out of King Harbor,in Redondo Beach and then,I was looking at the boat,like where's the actual stage going to be.,Where's the music going to be performed?,So we had to actually,build a stage on the boat,while it was going from,Redondo Beach to San Pedro.,We were hauling ass, basically.,And I'm slapping this stage together.,In my mind I just kept thinking,,D. Boon, I was thinking,,it's gotta hold him,,it's gotta hold D. Boon.,I don't think those boat,guys knew what was coming.,I don't think they wanted it to happen.,They probably had plenty,of weddings on the boat,and they were good with that.,They had never seen someone showing up,with a 1,000 watt tri-amplified sound rig,with four monitors on two mixes,and a 16 channel mixing board.,I just had a lot of stuff.,They stopped us from getting,on board in a timely manner.,So we had to do soundcheck,with everybody standing right there.,Let me hear a beat.,I must say that I've been,looking forward to this for a long time.,I've never played on a boat before.,I think for me, probably,just because we were on a boat,,and I'm from the desert, it's,just kind of like, oh a boat.,I like boats and stuff,,but I had never been to,a big harbor like that.,I didn't have any idea so I,was getting my eyes opened up,just seeing all those crates stacked up,and all the big cranes.,That gig was far out, man.,That was absolutely one of the highlights,of my musical career in a lot of ways.,Just magical as crap.,I'm from the fucking desert.,So you get me on a boat in the first place,and we're talking about,this thing is kind of wobbly,and I'm getting a little bit queasy,and then it starts chuggling around,the fucking harbor in there,and that was just completely,and entirely wonderful.,When the Meat Puppets started playing,,the stage had a little instability,and they were just kind,of bouncing up and down,and the way that the,speakers were set for the PA,were doing this and we're like,,oh shit, these things are gonna fall,,either on the audience or,into the water or something,and they had to stop the show,and whoever had put it up secured them.,I think they just got some ropes or straps.,And it was like good,sailing from there on out.,It was really great to be on the boat,moving at night, just cruising the harbor,and listening to rock music.,Just everything about that,,the big cranes to load the tankers.,Just everything down there is kind of weird,and it looks great at night.,I'm surprised they let you even rent,the charter boat to do that.,It was a little touch and go.,I don't think you can do that these days,,not with Homeland Security and stuff,,they wouldn't let you do it I don't think.,Now you can't even get near the harbor.,We did a lot of gigs and,we played a lot of places,,but it's always kind of nice,to play in your own hometown,because a lot of people don't really go,beyond their own town.,And then there we were,dancing as the boat cruised,at a good I don't know clip of 10.,Then it would get to the edge,where we were going to go out into the sea.,And it would turn around,while the band was playing,and it would come back,and it was the Minutemen,and we were all just kind,of skankin' on that ship.,On the 29th we're playing,for El Salvador once again.,I hope as many of you people,out there can go to that.,They were from Pedro, but we still kind of,considered them our own,here in Los Angeles.,They talked about stuff that,nobody talked about in songs.,Our band could be your life.,Real names be truth.,Me and Mike Watt, we played for years,,punk rock changed our lives.,We learned punk rock up in Hollywood.,Drove up from Pedro.,We were fucking corndogs.,We'd get fucked up and go pogo.,The Joy at Sea show was,in the middle of June 1984.,A lot of what we saw that night,were the songs that became,Double Nickels on the Dime,and it was really a peak,Minutemen experience.,That record dropped like a bomb.,They really upped their game.,Double Nickels really said,this is an important band.,By the time of Double Nickels on the Dime,,they're taking on all,these kind of pre-punk,American rootsy influences,,Dylan and The Band and,Creedence Clearwater,,that's sort of coming through.,It was the great underground,music of that era.,I saw Sonic Youth perform live,at this club called The Loft in Berlin.,I just was like, wow, these,guys are so different.,They're playing guitars but,the sounds that are coming out,don't sound anything like,anything I've heard before.,They were American and,I can go walk up to them,after the show and introduce myself.,Hey, if you're ever in LA,we should do a desert show.,Michael Sheppard put,out a seven inch record,,Death Valley 69, which had,Sonic Youth with Lydia Lunch.,We have a song called Death Valley 69.,It's all about this contemporary,reading we were having,of Charles Manson and the Manson Family,and sort of what that,meant in the Reagan era.,♪ Now, now, now ♪,♪ Death valley 69 ♪,Kim Gordon's parents lived in LA.,Kim grew up in LA, so they were visiting,,so we all decided to go,drive up to Spahn Ranch.,We're just like driving,dangerously around these cliffs,and smoking weed and seeing the trees,where they carved their names in.,We had a big Manson luncheon that day.,Things were changing.,Things were getting weirder.,Songs were getting longer,and bands were going off,in very different directions.,It was sort of this new thing emerging.,I think when we started hearing about,what was going on with,these gigs in the desert,with Neubauten and Survival,Research Laboratories,and Minutemen on the boat.,It just sounded like it was part and parcel,with all this kind of new weird,action that was happening.,I have this great,,typed letter from Thurston,from his trip to LA.,It was all about, you're,gonna love it out here.,They have all these great burgers,and me and Kim went with the,Nip Drivers up to Spahn Ranch,and they were taking some black gel acid,,but not me and Kim.,And then they came back,to visit Kim's family over Christmas,so we decided since they're,gonna be here anyway,,let's do a desert show.,So we picked the first,full moon after New Years,,which was January fifth.,The big change for that,show was we that decided,after much pressure from a lot of people,that didn't want to ride school buses,,we'd either let them drive,themselves or take the bus.,So we actually had both.,What we ended up doing was have people,go to a checkpoint in Victorville,and then they would get a map there,to go the rest of the way.,Little did I know that,going to that map point,would lead me down a path of going to shows,where I needed to go to map points first,for the next 30 or 40 years.,Because I'm still doing that.,You need to go and get your stamp,,try to get your stamp at the corner.,Okay.,Do you have stamps?,This is so tripendicular.,One, two, three.,Pass Lucerne Valley and take 247 east,,which is another road, 18 goes,south then get on 247 east.,Follow 24716 more miles,till you see a Desolation,Center gila monster sign.,Get on the dirt road.,Arriving at the desert, the,first thing I remember seeing,was the Blue Oyster Cult icon on this stone,overlooking the area,which we were gonna play,,which was basically a generator,and a jerry-rigged PA in the sand.,It was the west coast,premiere of Sonic Youth,so we had the Meat Puppets,and then Redd Kross,was a favorite of me and a,lot of friends at the time,as well as Sonic Youth.,Redd Kross were just so cute,and they were just so funny.,I think it took balls to,not be these punk rockers,and to just be these glam kids.,There was a period when punk,rock was a staunch thing,and they were into glam and Bowie.,My roommate at the time was Perry Farrell,,who went on to be Jane's,Addiction, and found Lollapalooza.,So Perry was like, we'll open,,and it was hard to turn that down.,It was before Jane's Addiction started,,so he was this funny guy with,the crazy long dreadlocks,in a band called Psi-Com that,played at the Anti Club a lot,to only a few people in the room.,I think if he wasn't helping us,they probably wouldn't have,opened up for the shows.,Perry's very funny and very likable,and a very good friend of ours,,but he was a guy who didn't mind certainly,pitching in and helping out.,You let us play for a short,time at the bottom there,which was really cool.,I thank you for that.,People were really sort,of in a really good mood,and I didn't really find out until later,that everybody was dosed.,Some chick I knew brought,like 500 hits of acid,and gave it to everybody.,Sonic Youth playing in the,desert on LSD is perfect.,The darkness in the music,,we were all feeling.,Like the Reaganomics and the,way the government was going.,There was a dark undercurrent in society.,It was there.,It's therapeutic in that weird way,because it releases all,whatever weird, negative energy,and then you associate this,really beautiful scenarios,with the music.,♪ Someone knockin' at my door ♪,♪ I don't need 'em anymore ♪,♪ Someone knockin' at my door ♪,To see Kim, a woman, playing bass.,All of a sudden I just,felt like that's what music,should sound like.,And she was just so badass.,She was a big part of that sound.,Sonic Youth had the most impact on me.,Maybe because it was the most,kind of alien at that point.,They're using their guitars in a way,that we had never seen anybody,use their guitars before.,People are like, whoa, what's going on.,At first it was kind of unexpected,,like what the fuck are these guys doing?,And then I just remember slowly,,more and more people gathering around,our little circle of sand,where we were playing.,I thought that was the best time for me,that I'd seen Sonic Youth.,That environment worked really,well for them with the music.,Turn the lights off.,They just came out and,started doing like a space jam.,I just clicked the lights off.,And it was cool, they,just did the whole set,with no lights in the middle of the desert.,When the lights were turned off,the whole area was illuminated,by nothing but the full moon.,And it just creates this,otherworldly landscape,and you're hearing this music,that's completely psychedelic.,What a unique opportunity,to be able to play out in,the middle of the desert,in the middle of the night in the dark.,There was enhancements involved,in the evening, if you will.,We were enhanced.,I was good and fucking enhanced.,There was very few people,that weren't tripping.,The moon was full, Joshua Trees around,,it was pretty weird.,You get a bunch of people on LSD together,and you have a group of people that are in,an enlightened state and then,that partly drives the music,that's coming out too,so it's a give and take.,I was walking around, I was like okay,,I'm seeing this thing.,I think I went around and,polled a few dozen people,,do you see this very,special thing happening,in the sky, in the air and,yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.,That was the community fry.,I was tripping, I was just tripping.,I think the whole crowd,was all sort of communally,coming on and there was just,one big drunken skinhead guy,,maybe not the brightest bulb in the bunch.,And he just grabbed a,hold of the microphone,and he just kept screaming,over and over again.,""We're in the desert!"",We're in the desert!,I see, we're in the desert, you see!,See we're in the desert!,Wow, I don't remember this at all.,Full moon, in the desert, the moon is full!,We played a show in San Francisco,so instead of trying to power out by car,,we flew from San Francisco to Burbank.,So this girl comes and,meets us at the airport,and she's in this huge,,early 70's big American car,with gigantic anarchy A's in black paint,on the hood and the doors and all this.,And so we're in the Anarchy-mobile,,that's what we dubbed it,,and this girl is just driving,like a bat out of heck.,And we obviously had no,idea where we were going.,She didn't seem to have any,idea where she was going either.,This is what we know.,There's a dirt road somewhere,in the Mojave Desert,and two or three miles off this dirt road,,there's this show.,And that's all we know.,There's no cell phones at this point.,It's not like you can call,someone and say hey, we're lost.,We're just lost.,Did anyone even know we were lost?,Would anybody come out looking?,Where would they find us?,We didn't know where we were.,And we're just lost, completely lost.,Because we just kept,taking random dirt roads,and driving in two miles,and then we'd see nothing,and we'd drive back out.,You couldn't see very far,,it was like being lost in a,cornfield for crying out loud.,It was pretty scary, we,were almost out of gas.,There was no light anywhere,except for the car headlights.,So we're lost for hours,and we're just at the mercy of this girl,just blazing through the desert.,And we see these two cars,and they seem to be driving in tandem.,So we're like, hey, you guys,trying to find this thing?,And they're like yeah, we've,been driving around for hours.,So we start this little,caravan of the three cars.,The Anarchy-mobile runs out of gas.,Apparently the car,belonged to her boyfriend,and she just didn't seem,to care in the least.,She was completely fine,just leaving the car there.,And it might still be there rusting,,two miles off some abandoned dirt road,in the middle of the Mojave,Desert for all I know.,We all had to transfer,to the other two cars.,And I was really bummed because full-on,we were missing the Meat,Puppets, we know at this point.,Let alone like we're on the,verge of missing the entire gig.,I ended up curled up in a fetal position,with a barbecue kind of like,wedged in between in the middle,and that's how I laid for hours.,We have an announcement,,just in case you haven't heard.,Redd Kross is going to,play next, they are here.,Can the girl who brougth Redd Kross here,come up here?,Caroline or whatever?,You got lost with us?,My acid is in your car, it's an emergency.,There was no equipment,,we had to fight with the,Meat Puppets about playing.,With everyone we found,enough amps to perform,Well we got there, we found,out everyone was on acid too.,Yeah, everyone was on acid,and there was no plans for us to get home.,It's a full moon tonight so.,We're in the desert!,I mean I was wearing sweats,,sweats and a bomber jacket.,Oh you had sweats on?,Yeah, I was in sweats.,The lemon yellow.,At the time we were a little flashier.,Yeah, we would never have gone on stage,without our proper stage attire.,And I'm wearing jeans and at that time,I would've never worn jeans on stage,but the night before we were all dolled up,and our clothes were soaking wet.,My pussy's ready for Redd Kross,♪ In the exorcist, baby ♪,♪ You were really insane ♪,♪ You got busted, you got dusted ♪,♪ You got busted for cocaine ♪,♪ You're born innocent girl ♪,♪ And that ain't all ♪,♪ You got it for the first,time baby in a shower stall ♪,♪ Kidnapped, raped and possessed ♪,♪ Linda is the best ♪,♪ She used to be on the run ♪,♪ But now she thinks it's a lot of fun ♪,♪ She takes her cigarettes,from her sleeve ♪,♪ Now she never wants to leave ♪,♪ Not even when she's 18 ♪,I mean the show was really, really fun.,It was freezing cold, but it was magical.,We love you and goodnight.,So many people that became,important in our lives,and that remain a part of our circle in LA,,we met them all there.,A lot of those people became friends for,really long periods of our career.,I don't know how things,would've been different,if that desert show never happened.,The fact that it did happen,,it California-ized Sonic,Youth like no other gig,would ever have done that.,After Gila Monster,Jamboree, I really felt like,I'd done three desert shows.,They were really cool, it,was a really great experience,for the people that were,there, the music was amazing.,I'm done, I don't need to,do anymore desert shows.,I never really had the idea of like,oh, let's start an annual,festival or anything.,It just didn't occur to me.,At that point in time,no one really made money putting on shows,and then I get a letter from,the Bureau of Land Management.,Dear Mister Swezey, you have admitted,to Chief Rnager Ken,Kleiber on January 13, 1985,that you were responsible for,promoting the rock concert.,You also admitted selling,200 tickets to the event.,We have determined trespass,damages to be $400.,It kind of freaked me out.,I thought I was doing this secret show,with no permits and all that,and yet the federal,government managed to find me.,I just really felt like wow,,something has changed here.,I'm on the radar.,We did leave a lot of,beer bottles out there.,We didn't do a great job of cleaning up,and I had to come up with this $400,,which at that time seemed,like a lot of money.,Then the Minutemen, the,Nip Drivers and Lawndale,,played a benefit at the Anti Club.,And we raised enough money to pay off,the Federal government.,By the summer of 1985,,I was completely done promoting shows.,A friend of mine came to me and said,we have grant money from,the National Endowment for the Arts,,would you want to put on a show,with the Swans and Sonic Youth?,On the one hand, I had,just finished paying off,the federal government and now I'm getting,a ton more grant money,to put on a show with,the coolest bands from New York.,It was sort of an effort to,become a little bit more legit.,So that event was called Solstice,and it was sort of a full cycle thing,where we kind of returned,back into downtown.,This was our first West Coast show.,For me that was kind of a pivotal moment,because I'm from LA.,It was a big deal to play there.,The open warehouse and the,fact that it wasn't a rock club,was really great.,Saccharine Trust opening,for us were just amazing.,So many nice things about that concert,,the Winter Solstice event,,but then there's this cloud.,I played out of D. Boon's amp that night.,We didn't have gear and I had an amp,that said Minutemen on the,side and it was D. Boon's twin,reverb or whatever it was,and it sounded great and everything.,I got home from something or,other and my sister told me.,And very upset, and she had,just heard, and just horrible.,It was really tragic.,Lost a friend and a really,amazing person and musician,,but also it just felt like,things were different.,It was like the end of an era, definitely,,just knowing the Minutemen,would never play again.,He was such a big part of,the heartbeat of that scene.,It was like somebody had,just pulled something,so significant out of your body,,and just like now, let's see how you walk.,Very big.,Mike, George and I obviously,,we'd all lost this important person.,How do you make any sense of that?,I had to let go of D. Boon at some point.,I couldn't keep thinking about him.,I couldn't even talk about him.,Couldn't even put in the song,until I got enough cajones up.,When D. Boon died that was like,the end of a lot of things.,Yeah, it sure was, it,was definitely a marker.,It was definitely a marker.,Like the utopia just started to unravel.,All the things that,had changed by that time,had finally caught up with me.,It wasn't just D. Boon being gone,,but it was the whole way,the LA scene had changed.,It kind of made me feel like it was time,to move on to something else.,At that time I was becoming,much more interested,in the ideas behind this music,and with a group of like-minded friends,I started Amok Books, a,subversive mail order catalog,publishing house and bookstore,that became a communal hub,for the L.A. underground.,L-O-L-L-A-P-A-L-O-O-Z-A.,Back in the 80's there,was a group of heathens,that put on parties in the desert,and we called ourself Desolation Center.,We had cult bands like the Minutemen,and the Meat Puppets and Sonic Youth.,I can see a connection between Perry,and these Desolation Center shows,to being inspiring enough to,get Lollapalooza out of it,because I think he wanted,a tribal experience too.,I definitely learned that to do a show,,to do a festival, what,made your shows so unique,,and what made the shows to follow,like the Burning Mans and the Lollapaloozas,and the Coachellas,,you have to concentrate,on being a great curator.,How could you not like,going out to the desert,where you feel free?,More people are paying attention,to Coachella than ever.,Once it started, it seemed,a little more local.,Now Coachella is for the world.,The live streams, whatever,,were 84 million or something.,I mean it's become a little more mainstream,but I think society's become,a little more mainstream.,People behave more.,The Desolation Center,shows, I had heard of,,from my friends, SRL.,I thought, what a great,cool idea, bringing out,these crazy fucking bands and SRL,and doing whatever the fuck,you want in the desert.,For me, it was one of the inspirations,when we started doing Burning Man.,Some of the early Burning Man things,were really anarchic.,A bunch of weirdos out,in the desert with guns.,And it's a drive by,shooting, ladies and gentlemen.,It was about accepting the adversity,of the desert environment,and making something,that was more extreme.,Closer to true danger and hazard.,As far as artistic,influences on Burning Man,,SRL was by far one of the,largest, all of the machine,artists and fire artists,in early Burning Man,had apprenticed at SRL.,The more extremist sort of philosophy,about how to deal with being out there,in the middle of nowhere was,really espoused by John Law.,Once he left, it was,never the same anymore.,I never wanted to grow it.,Personally as one of the main organizers,I didn't want to grow, I wanted,to let it go organically,,really slow, I didn't want to promote it,,didn't want to push it and,one of my other partners,relentlessly grew it any,way he possibly could.,In that moment, I had no,idea we were making history.,There was no point of,reference to understand,what a historical moment all of that was.,Part of the magic of,Desolation Center shows,and the heart of their mystique,is that they faded away,before they had a chance to sell out.,Before they had a chance,to become these cash cows.,Right when they're at,the precipice of becoming,something huge, they just stop.,So is that fair that only a few people,went to three desert adventures,or is that amazing that it stayed pure,and never became this thing,with all these expectations attached to it.,It was definitely one of,those doors that opens,and you're kind of,different on the other side.,I wanted to set something in motion,but I also didn't necessarily feel like,I had to be in control of it all.,It felt like some kind of,big group kind of experiment.,Everybody was safe, everybody was happy,,there was no incidents, no,one had to call an ambulance,,and people took care of each other.,Those shows definitely,reflected the feeling of that time,where just having,possibilities or having an idea,and just going with it shows that spirit of,yeah, I want to do this,,I'm going to make it happen.",https://subslikescript.com/movie/Desolation_Center-7130802
The Norseman (1978) - full transcript,"An eleventh century Viking Prince sails to America to find his father, who on a previous voyage had been captured by Indians.","This movie is based on,real events.

,Trage !,slow ! slow !,slow !,slow !,Eu sunt Eric Helge,,prinþ din Helgeland.,A kingdom,by the sea, in the land of the Nordics.,I was 12 when,my brother took me on board,,heading west, on the,sea ​​... beyond where the sun sets.,It was the year 1006 AD,,according to the Roman calendar,Less than a year before,, our father, King Eurich,,he had sailed west to discover,new lands, where no one had come before.,And he had never been seen again.,Our whole kingdom mourns,for my father and his people.,When my brother Thorvald,decided to go look for him,,
,
,
,he spread,joy throughout the land.,Now we were sailing in the swirling sea, in,our fastest drakkar, called ""Raven"".,Our dreams and hopes,were not just to find a new land,,but let us see our father again, and,let the people see their king again.,His helper was,Ragnar, a stubborn man,known for,his anger at the Saxons and the Celts.,Ragnar's son Rauric was,an experienced warrior.,This is Olaf, my brother's most loyal man,He can't talk.,His tongue was cut off,many years ago, in a,raid on the African coast.,El e cel care i-a tãiat-o.,He was overwhelmed by Olaf. He,now wears a severed tongue around his neck,They were joined by other warriors,,Ivar, Ode, Ubbi, and Björn.,All the ""living legends,"" of our country.,Every man on board,""Raven"" was chosen by my brother,for his courage in battle and his,knowledge of navigation.,The Wizard, ""The Visionary of Death"",he had a dark face and,frightening,,whose presence had provoked,a slight uneasiness,among the crew.,No one had ever seen his,face and he was always with his hawk.,My brother,,Thorvald the Bold.,He was a feared,and respected warrior among the Norse.,It was,my father's reliable support.,Our country has been peaceful,and prosperous for many years,,because of its great power.,Say the,spells, wizard!,Look in the darkness of the storm and,tell me! Is there a danger on the horizon?,The storm will stop. Tomorrow,we will arrive in a new land.,A new land? What do the stars tell you,about this new land?,A fertile ground awaits us.,But in the days to come,... there will be dangers.,So be it.,Sit down, young Eric.,We,are in danger tonight.,Glory be to the god Odin! I,found a new land in the west.,- For Odin!,- For Odin! For Odin!,NORDICUL,Subtitles: Cristian,82 / d'Artagnan,I was looking forward to hearing from you about the strange noises,I heard on the beach.,I heard some footsteps that I,recognized immediately. I breathed a sigh of relief,As I approached him,that morning ...

,It's stretching toward...,upward, reaching for each other.,That's it then.,Let's put it further back...,I read Tim Burton's memoir...,he wrote, ""The worst,problem on the film 'Big Fish'...,was that the actor had to be naked."",""And the mosquitoes bit."",But we won't have any mosquitoes.,And Chernobyl mosquitoes?,Seeing Fedor, I realized,that he was from another world.,He doesn't fit with,people of this day and age.,My friends say,contradictory things about him.,Some say, ""He's crazy, an idiot!"",""He has dirty fingernails.,He doesn't brush his teeth."",But the smarter ones...,say that Fedor is a genius.,And everything he does is theater.,He thinks differently from others.,A little crazy, a little strange...,but always honest.,During the Chernobyl,catastrophe they sent away the children...,so they wouldn't,suffer from the radiation in Kiev.,I remember people were in a panic.,And I was sent to an orphanage...,because my parents couldn't be with me.,I was four years old.,I told the children,,""I'm just here temporarily..."",""My parents are coming back for me."",They said, ""All parents,say that, you'll be here forever!"",And I believed it.,I thought I'd be there forever.,It's actually quite a,serious trauma for a child.,And from that time,I've felt strange... different.,Fedor is so tragic.,From childhood he was,a delicate, agitable, gifted boy.,And he spoke like an adult.,His speech was so rich and mature.,Also, he was a pacifist.,When he was six,,he put on a tuxedo and a bowler hat...,and went to the children with a letter...,asking them not to play at war.,He started collecting signatures.,They beat him up.,After that, he,stopped collecting signatures.,When they did an analysis...,they found radioactive,strontium in his bones.,They wanted us to treat him with hormones.,He's suffered so,much, his health especially...,all from Chernobyl.,Fedor had long wanted,to make a film about Chernobyl.,Because it's been more than 27 years...,and the cause of the,explosion is not clear.,I remembered a story from my father...,who was in the Soviet Air Force.,After the explosion,,he flew directly over the reactor.,He said he saw,a giant luminous pyramid there.,And it gleamed in the,rays of the setting sun.,When Fedor heard the story...,he got really excited,and wanted to go there.,He found an old Soviet map...,And where my father,saw the shining object...,""Boy Scout Camp"" was written.,Many people tried to dissuade,him, because it's a radioactive zone.,But Fedor ignored them.,Because he felt there was a secret here...,that could shed light,on the Chernobyl explosion.,Na... tio... nal Museum.,And lower?,Cher... no... byl.,We're going to see a,terrible catastrophe...,That happened when I was just your age.,Nobody knows why it happened.,I'm trying to find out why it happened...,and who is guilty.,During the nighttime,they did an experiment.,But the experiment was wrong, forbidden.,They weren't supposed to do it?,No, they shouldn't have.,Is it poison?,Yes, it's poison.,When the explosion happened,,no one thought anything of it.,Maybe some people knew about the radiation.,They put on masks and we were surprised.,Why wear a mask in such good weather?,Life went on as normal.,Many went sunbathing at the river.,Trucks came to wash the streets.,We thought it was for a holiday.,Our children played in that water.,From the station came a,beautiful raspberry-colored steam.,And to see it better,,people gathered at a bridge.,But it turned out the,bridge had the most radiation.,Attention! Attention!,Attention! Attention!,Dear Comrades:,There has been an accident...,at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.,The Communist Party,is taking all necessary measures.,However, in order to fully,protect our citizens' health...,children being the highest priority...,It has become necessary to implement...,a temporary evacuation.,As you all know,,a misfortune has recently befallen us.,The government did everything possible,to hide the magnitude of this accident.,I can say with confidence,that they didn't think about the people.,If such a disaster happens...,We must learn a lesson,so it doesn't happen again.,But even specialists,are barred from documents...,that they could be researching.,When Ukraine became independent...,professional historians,had the possibility...,and the need to try to find the truth.,But I went to the,archives and nothing is there.,Everything was disbanded...,scattered about...,and in short, destroyed.,We are on the edge of Kiev.,Beyond the Kiev Sea,is the Chernobyl nuclear station.,This sea is radioactive.,This is the water of,Lethe, the water of forgetfulness.,Because not much time has passed...,and people have forgotten this tragedy.,I remember in my childhood,,after they sent away the children...,they said red wine,protects against radiation.,So let us make an offering...,to the gods of the underworld...,with the blood of this wine...,that we may find the truth.,STOP! FORBIDDEN RADIOACTIVE ZONE,but I asked, was it a crime?,And I answered, there was a trial...,Therefore there was a crime. Correct?,We're speaking different languages...,We have agreed it was a crime.,I have one question:,""Are you a nuclear scientist?"",I'm an artist.,Ðnd simply a citizen of this country.,I'm a lawyer and military worker.,And I think that experts should,discuss and express their opinions.,No, why? Why only specialists?,I'm asking experts their opinions...,If your car breaks down, can you repair it?,Yes, I repair my own car.,It's a hobby of mine.,Interesting...,And nuclear energy,,do you understand it too?,No. But I hope those who,are watching might understand.,We're collecting different views.,People should hear different opinions.,I'm trying to understand,and I'm told it's a mystery...,Veil of Isis, whatnot.,I want to know the truth.,If it was a crime and,people were condemned...,But to this day, there are still,disputes about who is to blame.,Maybe the perpetrators,have not yet been found.,Our town was awesome.,It was clean and green.,We had an incredible number of roses.,And there were a lot of children.,And lots of joy.,We had fantastic provisions.,We had ketchup. Marvelous.,We had chicken.,It wasn't a city, it was a fairytale.,We're now not too far,from the Chernobyl station.,In a destroyed amusement park...,in a dead city, a ghost town...,where everything is steeped in radiation...,and deathly dangerous.,These gas masks,were for the schoolchildren.,But they don't protect against radiation.,And they're all that's left of this school.,In 1976, a radio signal,terrorized the Western world.,The signal was traced to,a small town in the Soviet Union...,Chernobyl.,Home to one of the,largest nuclear reactors in Europe.,And hiding in its shadows...,stands a steel monster...,taller than the Great Pyramid of Giza.,When driving home,from work, on the left side...,a watchtower was visible.,But it was a closed military town.,What was there? Some said a radio antenna.,Others said some kind of interceptor.,They toyed with all kinds of ideas.,But what it really was?,No one knew.,If they said it was,forbidden, then it was forbidden.,No one was even allowed to ask.,Why ask? Just to be punished?,We're at the,epicenter of the Chernobyl catastrophe.,We face a mystery: What was that sound?,And why was the Duga antenna built here?,There is no connection,to the Chernobyl station's energy.,The whole world knows this,sound as the ""Russian Woodpecker."",Most people connect this,to an over-the-horizon antenna.,Namely the Duga,next to the Chernobyl station.,Is that possible?,No, it's not possible, for several reasons.,The fact of the matter is,,the Chernobyl radar...,It didn't work, so it,couldn't make any interference.,Second, this antenna,was built to look in a narrow range...,to the south.,Not toward America or Europe.,Could there be a,connection between the Duga radar...,and the accident at Chernobyl?,That's another question, let,me tell you about Stalin instead.,First, everything,people say about his brutality...,is simply impossible.,Because Stalin graduated from a seminary...,and he was meant to take Holy Orders.,Holy Orders.,But he was such an outstanding person...,that when he saw injustice...,he decided to become a revolutionary.,Many people still have a Soviet mentality.,They swore an oath...,they signed their names.,In comes a,foreign journalist, and they clam up.,They start acting,according to their former orders.,What can I tell you about the antenna?,Steel...,Tall...,It hummed in the wind.,They remember the KGB...,about being under constant surveillance.,""God forbid I give away some secret."",Military secret.,Cheers.,Thank you so much,,you gave us valuable information.,I did my best not to give,any valuable information.,Don't flatter me.,I'm a military man.,The object is also military.,And very classified.,Remember you showed,us a list of telephone numbers...,of people who served at the Duga?,But then you didn't,want to give it to us...,when you saw an American with us.,That's right.,I won't give it.,Understand, there are things that...,Are you a Ukrainian citizen?,I am a Ukrainian citizen.,And I am a Ukrainian citizen.,And I will remain so.,There are things you,shouldn't blabber about.,So you don't want,anything to do with Americans?,In this matter, yes.,May I use the bathroom?,Our object was a system,for missile warning.,In 10 years we,detected every Shuttle launch.,All.,And during that time,,every country in the world...,heard the Woodpecker.,This tap-tap-tap-tap,,this 10 hertz signal...,Yes, it resembles a,woodpecker knocking on a tree.,So the Woodpecker,signal came from the Duga?,Well, yes.,I will answer as a radar specialist.,In fact, I'm nicknamed ""Antenna Man."",Since the Earth is round...,you will never see all of it.,Because there is a zone of invisibility.,Here you can see, and here you can see.,But here you can't see.,Now, to speak specifically,about the Chernobyl antenna...,this is one of three super-powerful...,over-the-horizon radars.,The antenna cost twice as much,as the Chernobyl nuclear plant.,Around seven billion Russian rubles.,It works because of the ionosphere...,The ray bounces off the ionosphere...,bounces off the,Earth and grabs information.,And then comes back.,It's a curved gun.,The Duga caused a lot of problems.,Not only in Europe, but in the USSR.,Our radar interfered with SOS signals.,So the head technician came...,and changed the frequency.,But at this new frequency...,our signal was unable,to overcome the Northern Lights.,It's difficult for me to speak...,Because what I see is not a human creation.,It's the creation of Empire.,And this pile of metal was,useless from the very beginning.,It was useless before it was even built.,It had no theoretical basis to function...,and so it was doomed from the start.,This iron curtain was the,source of the Russian Woodpecker sound.,And this Iron Curtain...,was known as ""The Eye of Moscow."",The ""Moscow Eye"" next,to an atomic heart, Chernobyl station...,the heart of the Soviet Union.,But this eye was blind.,This antenna didn't work.,Could there be a,connection between this blind eye...,And the bursting of the atomic heart?,Somehow they're connected...,but it's a mystery.,Because for me it was a huge tragedy.,And every tragedy must have a reason.,There are no coincidences.,The collapse of the Soviet Union...,was the greatest,geopolitical catastrophe of the century.,We know that the Soviet system is evil.,It started with evil...,And ended with the greatest,evil, the Chernobyl disaster.,And again there are,victims and will be victims.,And again there will be war.,When Fedor started,researching the Duga antenna...,he really scared me.,I'm afraid because he's,exploring a topic no one has raised.,Because we live in a criminal country.,We are far from a democracy.,We don't have freedom of press.,Of course I'm afraid for my only son.,And don't forget Stalin,physically destroyed our family.,Both of my grandmothers,were sent to the gulag.,The reflections of,the Soviet Union remain...,and these people are still here.,They are among us.,He was my older brother.,Petro.,They came for him during his lessons.,Soviet partisans.,They shot him.,I can't...,It's hard for me to tell this story.,I was a child...,but I loved him more,than anything in the world.,My father had it worst of all.,Someone from the KGB arrived...,""You have to write that your,parents are enemies of the state."",Papa said, ""Give me a minute to think."",Then he threw an inkstand at him.,He hid behind the table,and the inkstand crashed into a wall.,Of course, he also,went to the gulag for that.,That was my father.,Fedor's behavior is similar.,This was the Chief Designer.,Video recording, no...,Could you show us,a model and answer a few questions?,Hold on, what kind of questions?,Why are you suddenly interested in this?,Yes! That's it. That's it.,Oh my god, so beautiful.,The Americans always,put us in an interesting situation.,They pulled their,equipment close to our borders...,making it easier to monitor our territory.,And to compensate for,our lack of information...,this system was created...,which was called the Duga.,We were provoked, so we had to respond.,Therefore we created tools like the Duga...,so there wouldn't be a war.,Why were all these documents,,materials, archives destroyed?,You are asking a very delicate question.,Some things I don't understand,and don't want to understand.,And I don't want to talk about this topic.,Why were the Americans,afraid of the Chernobyl radar?,Because our signal could have covered...,all nine US missile bases.,And this was a deterrent.,Our antenna gave the,government 25 minutes...,To make a decision.,What could we have done in only 10 minutes?,Well, they could have said...,""Go hide under a table."",But with 25 minutes,,we can give the command...,to launch our own missiles.,So the antenna was on combat duty...,The Duga never entered combat mode.,Before the accident of April 1986...,we were making our final revisions...,after which we would go to combat mode...,in September, 1986.,Instead, we got an,Order of Closure and Liquidation.,There were only three,or four months until September.,You know that the Duga,didn't work very well, right?,Of course.,And on September 1st, 1986,a commission was to inspect the Duga?,Therefore, the Chernobyl catastrophe,benefited the builders of the Duga?,Of course. Without a doubt.,It could be at the,very least a motivation...,for those responsible for the Duga...,which cost a lot of money...,and in the end didn't work.,It didn't work because it was,to someone's advantage to close it.,In general, there,were so many irregularities.,If you read the official version quickly...,everything looks normal, logical.,But when you start to look deeper,,and ask why this... and why that...,There are a lot,of questions, and no answers.,Maybe if something,so important didn't work...,The best way to hide the failure...,is to blame it on the accident.,If we're searching for who benefited...,we can say that,the builder of the Duga did.,Maybe, yes.,They pushed the,personnel to take a big risk.,In the end, they drove the,reactor into a dangerous state...,And then an,uncontrolled chain reaction began.,Do you know the Soviet punishment...,For misappropriating government funds?,The death sentence.,This statute applied to,whoever wasted those 7 billion.,And to save his life, maybe he,caused the Chernobyl catastrophe.,I'll answer as someone who,has worked 26 years at this station.,I ran the reactor with my own hands.,So I know what I'm talking about.,Your version is extremely fantastical.,Very.,It's clearly fantastical, but...,I think not.,""No because...""?,I would never have,allowed such a thing to happen.,So we can say...,Artem, is the camera running?,So no one claims we edited this...,I'll repeat it in a full sentence.,The theory that Chernobyl,was exploded on purpose...,to hide the non-functioning Duga...,Bullshit.,So much malarkey and fantasies.,First, zombies...,That we blew up Chernobyl station.,Stupidity.,It's a theory.,I'm not a prosecutor, I'm not a journalist.,I'm just a person.,Behind this there must be one person.,And all roads lead to Moscow.,Because the Duga reported to Moscow...,And the Chernobyl,station reported to Moscow.,So, the Woodpecker truly is Russian...,Even though he resides in Ukraine.,And if we connect,this person to the Woodpecker...,we will understand everything.,One day he was,reading and I was watching...,Then it was as if something had stung him.,""I discovered who did it!"",""Look, Artem, look! I found it!"",And then he showed me.,It was the first time I heard his theory.,And I was convinced.,Fedor investigated,all the builders of the Duga...,and found one person who,had the motive and the power...,to cause the catastrophe.,Well, this is in the,realm of conspiracy theories...,Such a person exists.,I'll tell you who he is.,It was one Shamshin.,I ask that we not,mention his name on air...,And is he still alive?,No, he died in 2009.,He started work on,over-the-horizon radar in 1948.,And he was,responsible for the Duga's construction.,And this man...,became Minister of Communications,when the Duga was launched.,The Vice-President of the,Soviet-Cuban Friendship Society...,Soviet Minister Shamshin...,noted that heroic Soviet,support led to the Cuban revolution...,which gave a strong impulse,to the liberation of Latin America.,This shows his significance.,He's Minister and Vice President,of the Soviet-Cuban Friendship Society.,It's important because ""Soviet-Cuban,friendship"" means ""war against the US."",Only America and the,Soviet Union could pull off...,a system as powerful as,the over-the-horizon radar.,And Shamshin insisted on building it.,Shamshin was not alone,in supporting the creation of the Duga.,At the very top, he was alone.,But the physicist Kabanov said...,that it's impossible,to build such an antenna.,So if it came out that it didn't work...,Shamshin would have had big problems?,Of course, big problems.,Is it even technically possible...,if you had the power...,to create such a grand catastrophe?,Well, there are dozens,of ways to blow up the reactor.,It's not difficult.,There is testimony from,a quite respectable person.,Komarov.,I advise you to meet with,him to discuss the matter.,While he is still alive...,I served on the Expert Commission...,of the General,Prosecutor's office of the USSR.,I was head of the commission,for the investigation of the accident.,I had access to all documents,provided to the Prosecutor's office.,I was at the Chernobyl,station during its construction.,I was Deputy Chief,Engineer of Science and Safety.,After this I was sent to Moscow.,And joined the Central Committee,of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.,Kopchinski, the Head of Atomic Energy,,insisted they proceed with the experiment.,But the reactor was unstable,,working under capacity for a day.,Proceeding with that,experiment was suicide.,There was constant communication between,Kopchinski and the Shift Supervisor.,I talked to a lot of personnel,and they agreed it all hangs on this call.,And it was the cause of the catastrophe.,First of all, I was home, naturally.,Naturally, I was in bed.,My son and daughter are,witnesses that I was at home.,When Kopchinski says,there was no telephone connection...,between his apartment and the station...,it's nonsense.,You can call the station,from any apartment.,Mr. Komarov should,know, if he's such an expert...,That no one can give a command,,not even the General Secretary...,to the personnel of a nuclear power plant.,A Chernobyl engineer can't argue with a,senior official of the Communist Party.,Why on Earth would a senior engineer...,take a risk when it's clear,you can't start up the block?,I ask you the question.,Destroy everything? They lost their minds?,You can't turn on the block!,It's a crime.,The day shift refused,to do it, but the late shift agreed.,And they blew up the reactor.,There can be only one reason...,Someone pushed them.,The transcripts of all,intercity calls are in two publications.,My voice appears only after the accident.,In principle he could have destroyed them.,Because the KGB took orders from the Party.,All these fairytales about,a command from Moscow...,that it was planned...,These tales are crafted,by odious and dirty people.,Just such a person is Komarov.,If that call took place,,it ought to be in the archives.,But the calls and times,in the record don't match.,In fact, the tape they,provided us was falsified.,To prove this, you need all the documents.,But till this time the,documents are classified.,About Kopchinski...,We have a saying:,""Feathers are sticking to his muzzle."",He...,He has a record of bad deeds...,significant ones.,If you suspect he's lying, he's capable.,He's capable of lying.,Komarov says there,was a call from Kopchinski.,He and his colleagues,heard recordings of the call.,It wasn't just one call,,it was a continuous conversation...,Kopchinski denies it.,He says he was home asleep.,But there was one man...,for whom this call was necessary.,An all-powerful man.,Were you acquainted with Vasily Shamshin?,Shamshin?,There was no such man.,He's uncomfortable...,Minister of Communications?,He made that call on orders from Shamshin.,But he never expected,that this truth would come out.,We've followed leads,and arranged various threads.,And not once has a thread snapped.,Every time we make an,assumption, it turns out true.,To me it's obvious.,But we'll never find,evidence to convince the doubters.,The kind of evidence that,could stand in a Nuremberg trial.,Because after the Nuremberg trials...,intelligent politicians stopped,leaving that sort of evidence behind.,This is the year our story begins.,This is the year Shamshin's Duga was born.,Shamshin rose through the ranks,thanks to the over-the-horizon radar.,The year they turned on the Duga.,He becomes Minister,of Communications of the USSR.,1984: A new wave of repression.,How did Shamshin feel during this time...,realizing that the Duga didn't work?,Some sort of plan arose within Shamshin.,The most important year for Shamshin.,In March, Shamshin became a member,of the Communist Party Central Committee.,The highest leadership of the country.,And we know that in September,the Committee will give its verdict...,on the most important,act in the life of Shamshin:,The Duga.,We know the story of a call from Moscow.,On the night of the tragedy.,The call that instigated the tragedy.,This was the final experiment,in a series that took place all spring...,up to April 26th.,A day that is located,between March and September.,A day...,that destroyed three countries.,And which saved Shamshin.,Because after the Chernobyl catastrophe...,no commission came to inspect the Duga.,""April 26th"",A tragedy which left,behind deserted and dead lands.,A tragedy which took place,because of a call from Moscow...,to save the career of a Moscow bureaucrat.,Film is not literal,,it speaks of emotions through image.,We have an anti-hero.,I'm the hero...,Shamshin is the anti-hero.,And we have a conflict.

The Moo Man (2013) - full transcript,"Modern British dairy farms must get bigger and bigger or go under but Farmer Stephen Hook decides to buck the trend. Instead he chooses to have a great relationship with his small herd of cows and ignore the big supermarkets and dairies.

You suck my fingers!,They're being really excited,Because they know there's milk there,They're not sure how to get it,Because it is not out of a teat,No? It's not going to happen?,It is the toughest day,in the year for the mum,That's about it. You did pretty good.,Didn't you, hey?,So we're not so bad after all. We're,going to give you your food from now on.,We've looked after your girl very well,She knows her calf is in there,It's the first time she hasn't,gone in with her calf,But she'll be a bit upset, because she...,They're really talking to,each other, aren't they?,Yeah.,That, I'm afraid, is life,A cow has to have a calf to have milk,Given that situation, we have to manage,it as best as we possibly can for the cow,In terms of minimising its stress,When we separate the cow from the calf,But it has to be done. You,cannot have calves on cows forever,They've got to be taken off,the cow at some point,- Yes?,- Hello, it's milk!,Just a minute,This is Ida, who is on the milk bottles,We want to do some promotional shots in Eastbourne,where we're going to start a new milk round,And we want to take Ida into Eastbourne,But she's not halter trained at all,None of our cows are halter,trained at the moment,So we're going to have a go,at putting her on a halter,And now I am just making friends with her,And bribing her with a bit of food,Get your head out of it!,Come on!,God, you're strong,Get your head out of it. That's it.,Good girl!,That's a good girl,Alright,- Actually, can you open the gate, Paul?,- Yeah.,Come on girl. Come on then.,Let's get you used to walking,Shall I take the food?,Yeah, that's a good idea,Just hold it like a yard in front of her,That's it, give it a shake and she'll...,That's it,Keep walking her round,You are not bad, are you?,We can do what we like,with you, can't we, hey?,Aren't you being good?,She's not trying to get away or,she's not bothered about the halter,No,Alright, okay then Ida, we'll let you go,You can go up the field with your mates,You're quite a pretty old thing,really, aren't you?,Thank you!,Yeah you are as well, Paul,Come on then, come on then.,Come on then.,Come on Ida, you're getting,your photo taken from over there,Hello Ida, hello.,Hello darling!,We could be all day here, couldn't we?,Actually there's going to be,more people as it goes along,You're beautiful, aren't you?,I hope they're going to give you a,special treat when you come home,We've got some feed here. Here you are.,You hold your hand out flat,,she'll take this off your hand.,Is this a new venture for you?,We've got a door step delivery in Hailsham,and we're going to start one in Eastbourne,It is going to be raw milk,we deliver. Unpasteurised.,So is this unhomogenised as well then?,Yeah, well this has only,been filled this morning,In a few hours the cream line,will be about down there,And you have that on your cereal,You've done really well, haven't you Ida?,There's a good girl,You've done really well, haven't you, hey?,We've never had a cow from,the Hailsham herd up here before,Smelling a bit of sea air,You are a good girl, aren't you?,You like Eastbourne, do you?,Come on then girl. We'll go home now,You really like it up here, don't you?,Come on then, we'll go back home.,Come on, Ida!,It will be better to back,the trailer up to her!,Yes, that's it. Well done Paul.,Come on, Ida!,Come on, Ida!,I think Ida just wants to live here now,Like a lot of people she,wants to retire in Eastbourne,Back with your mates again,You'd think they hadn't seen,each other for a long time,Go on. Your mates again.,Got all her fans, come to say hello to her.,Yeah, that's given us maybe,some ideas, we'll use Ida more.,'cause you lot, I don't think you,lot are going to be as good as Ida.,As much as you'd love to get the sea air.,Have you come and say hello? Do you,want to go back to Eastbourne, do you?,Hey? Do you like that?,But you haven't been milked, you're,going to get milked this afternoon now.,Which should be alright, you haven't got a lot of,milk, have you? Coming to the end of your lactation.,We've got a heifer that calved in this field.,She calved a bit early and had a big calf.,And the calf was dead,And she's got paralysis in one of,her legs and hasn't been able to get up,I can't see her at the moment which,means she's probably laid right out,She's sort of on her side and,can't get up I imagine,It's a nice heifer, so we don't,want to loose her.,Hello girl,Are you struggling again?,You've moved quite a bit though,I'll give you a push up in a moment,You want to try and get up?,How did you get over here then?,Did you walk over here? Did you?,Up you get then, come on, up you get,You don't want to know, do you?,Okay, I'll give you some grub,Are you thirsty?,How are you going to behave with me,now? Are you going to be alright with me?,That means ""Get off!,I don't like that"". Isn't it?,Now you've got your grub you can,shake your head at me, can't you?,There's a good girl.,It ain't too bad, is it?,You wouldn't have let me do that,with you earlier on, would you?,Let's hope you get better,You are a pretty little thing really,Within a group of animals you'll,always have a friendly one,And you'll always have one that,doesn't want to know you at all,But if a friendly one follows you,And two or three then follow that one and,then the rest follow then you've cracked it,It is harder than it was in the past,because the numbers of cattle per,stockman are a lot higher now,I think the average numbers per stockman,is something like 150 cows per stockman now,Whereas 20, 25 years ago that would,have been between 50 and 75 probably,Our ratios here are like what,they used to be,That's why we've still got that relationship,,but it gets harder once you get into big numbers,To know your cows individually and,to have that relationship with them.,Are you going to get up?,Do you want to give it a go?,What are you thinking about?,Don't you like me sitting here?,What's going on?,Are you going to give it a go?,I'm surprised you haven't drunk anything,Come on then, come on then.,We'll leave you, shall we?,Shall we leave you?,I've got cows to milk,Come on, Kate.,Come on then.,That's it. Well done.,She's over there, she's walked about,100 yards from where she was earlier,Brilliant to see her up,The only trouble is she's walked 100 yards that way,and I want her to walk that way to join the herd,Which is going to take a bit of,doing, but anyway,She's over there, we've seen her and I'm really,thrilled that she is up again after a week of being down,Which way are you going to go?,Are you going around the trees then?,Or are you going to follow me?,Come on then. Come on then.,Good girl, that's it.,You know where you're going now, don't you?,You lot had thought you're,coming out, didn't you?,Tough. You're not.,The only thing is, because she's a weak cow, some,know she's a weak cow and bully her a little bit,But they are more interested in coming out,She's alright,She's just going down into the field now,Which is good,Hi Dad, it's me,I still have to come and bottle,I'm just going to have a bit of tea first,Okay, see you later, bye,Oh bugger,I'm not very domesticated,Is my saucepan alright?,Yeah, it's fine,Our saucepan, darling,You put the heat on and then,you don't put anything in it,How do you know?,I can hear it,You've got a very good hearing,when you want to haven't you, darling?,Pardon?,You have got a very good ...yeah...,Case in point,Is it a nice bath?,- Yes, thank you.,- Good.,Are you sure you don't want,a glass of wine?,- I have one.,- Have you?,Claire cooks everything really.,We don't have any ready made stuff,Use our own beef, which saves a fortune,The boys enjoy that,What have you got then?,What have you had?,You had that quickly, didn't you?,It's alright. A big calf.,That's quite a good size calf and,she did well to have it on her own,But it's a bull calf, a friesian bull calf,So that on most dairy farms that little fellow,would be shot at birth, taken away and shot,It doesn't see its first day,But we keep all the bull calves and,he'll grow to become a beef animal,So he'll have about two and,a half years on the farm,He was quite a big fellow, that went in.,He was about three years old, old Kato.,Something like that, I reckon,He was never very friendly,,not like some of the others,Some of the others you go up to and,pat, but he was always a little bit wary,I don't know why. He was castrated,That normally quietens them down,He had a bad infection in his foot,when he was about a year old,Which we trimmed and that cleared up,I don't know how he'd done it. He,cut the back of his hoof in some way,Otherwise he's been fine,Kato has had a pretty brilliant life,for a dairy bull calf born on the farm,Alright, Tinky,It's me, you daft dog.,What have you got then, girl?,Bull calf,You are a big old fellow, ain't you?,Can you get up already?,Shame it's not a heifer calf. We've,had lots of bull calves recently.,What do you think then, girl?,I can't think which one that is.,It must be your 6th or 7th,Oh my goodness!,Come on then, up you get.,A little friesian heifer calf.,Quite a good size.,They don't normally calve down here,Come on then. Follow your mum.,We better walk you up the farm.,That's a surprise?,Yes, it's a surprise. It's a bit early.,Its still got a very fleshy navel,Oh, don't clear off,You look out Tinky.,She won't like you being about.,That's it. Follow your mum.,We'll get through these rushes, in a minute,You'll see where you're going,a bit better then,Bess, you're right in the way.,It's your calf, girl.,Come on, you.,You're going the wrong way.,Come on, trouble maker. Go on.,Hello trouble.,How are you then trouble?,Get up, go on.,You would think she was the mum,Come on you, come on. Up you get.,Being all possessive.,You keep going, little fellow.,Come on, it's not your calf.,It's your calf, isn't it girl?,You won't have yours for another,two weeks yet. Or three weeks.,Come on, go and join your calf, go on.,Good girl, that's it.,I'll put you some fresh,straw in in a minute.,That's good.,Come on then.,Oh, you dozy... you dozy animals.,Are they going through the,brambles or coming back?,Well, stuck in between.,Poxy animals.,What a job that was.,Hopeless, wasn't it?,O dear, oh dear.,Fit as a butcher's dog.,[crows calling },I wonder whether she's dislocated her hip,That's enough, Bess!,Hello, it's Steve Hook from,Longleys farm, Hailsham,Could I have a vet to look at a,cow this afternoon please?,She calved a few days ago,,quite a bad calving,And she had paralysis in her back right leg,She was walking two days ago, in the field,But now she won't get up at all,Her leg just doesn't look quite right,Half two?,Great, okay. Yeah, that's great.,Thanks very much. Okay, bye.,Potentially she has eight years,of milking ahead of her,It's right at the start of her production,life that we're going to lose her,If the leg's no good,But if she can't walk to the milking parlour,and get milked, then she'll have to go,Right. Let's get you some water.,Hello trouble,We've lifted her up,I think she's got a dislocated hip,She's got a dislocated hip?,If you go on here... listen,You can hear it clunking,Well, basically she's got no chance really,The annoying thing is, there's,probably actually nothing wrong with her,She's great,And she's a second calver as well,Just sort of really getting to,a good part of her life,Oh well.,It's a bit of a bugger, isn't it really.,But at least we know now.,Oh well,You just feel a bit robbed really,It's not a nice way for a cow to,finish its time on the farm,But you have to do it,If the cow is in pain and,can't get up, can't walk,And there is nothing that,can be done for it,You have to have her put down,And that's the end of it,It's not very nice like... you know,,when Ida goes, that'll be a very sad day,Because she is...,there is a difference between,Having a great relationship with the cows,Being able to stroke them, and go up to,them and they're alright with you and so on,That's one thing, but then,A little bit further on from that, they,almost become a pet, which is where Ida is,And that is where it becomes harder,Just that little bit of a closer,link or relationship,But then Ida, she might end up staying,here as an old girl and see her days here,I wouldn't be surprised,Hello girls. Milking time.,I don't know where Ida's got to,Probably at the back there somewhere,Yeah, she's at the back,Come on, Ida.,Come on girl.,What are you doing then?,Are you going to come and say hello?,You remember Andy, don't you, hey?,You remember the cameraman?,That brings back memories,of Eastbourne, I expect?,Doesn't it?,You're daft old thing, ain't you?,Go on then, in you go.,You're not going to Eastbourne today.,Hello you lot, you must be pretty thirsty.,Water. You need some water, don't you?,I went to a farmers' meeting,not so long ago,Only a month ago,And a chap, he farms in Oxfordshire,He reckoned that TB was,spreading down the Thames,About 10 miles a year,He's never had TB in all his,60 years he'd been farming,And they just got it,The day I saw him he had,50 cattle being killed for TB,And he was, you know, really upset about it,Why on earth can't TB be eradicated?,If TB was eradicated then the,badger population would be healthy,And the cattle population would be healthy,Why isn't it eradicated?,It's not eradicated, because... there's,an uneven policy in terms of eradicating it,In that cattle that have got TB,are being killed,Badgers that have got TB,aren't being killed,That's where the imbalance lies,Come on.,Push up.,That's it.,Hopefully we won't have any,conclusives or any reactors,And then we can say, be on the next invoice,We've just had a TB test,TB is the one really,,because the way that's...,That's going to be in the news,- Oh, she's a bump, is she?,- She has, yeah.,No, that's fine. She's got two lumps,but the avian one is much bigger,So that's fine,Alright, so that's alright then,It does worry me when I see you,stopping and writing things down,Come on then,Come on then,Come on then,There's always one,Come on then,Come on then,That's it!,That wasn't too bad,We've just passed out TB test,Animals are TB free,Which means we've got another,year of selling organic milk as raw milk,Alright girl,You're not coming out,What number of calf will,this be for her, Steve?,I don't know, number eight?,Something like that.,If Ida does't get on with it soon,I'll put some ropes on its feet,and start to pull,And then she'll start to push... anyway,Alright girl, alright,Good girl, that's it. You start pushing.,Alright, there's the nose,It's alive,Popping its tongue out,Come on, Ida,Have you got another little Ida, have you?,Come on, Ida.

Come on,,let's have the head out.,Nearly out, isn't it?,Come on, nearly there,Nearly,My feet keep slipping,Nearly out!,Come on push girl. I'll pull and you push.,I can't pull you there.,Too close to the wall.,If I can't get it out,,I'll have to get a jack on it,And you sort of ratchet it out then.,Just the head.

Would that do it?,It's normally a wire,,because it perforates through,Especially if I can hear,strange heart sounds,It might be that it worked its,way from the rumen into the heart,Into the region of the heart,Blimey!,Come on, Ida!,Oh, you're on my foot!,Steve reassures Ida,Good girl,Are you in?,Is it anything to do with her age,,do you think? Because she's 12.,- It could be heart failure. Possibly.,- Yeah?,But it doesn't explain the pain,Normally a pain like that, combined,with heart noises, is generally a wire.,But all you can do really is try,and feed her up.,Try the anti-inflammatory and,see if that gets her eating a bit more.,Yeah, yeah.,We'll check on her in a couple,of days and see how she's doing.,Okay.,- Fingers crossed.,- Yeah.,Thanks, Nicky.,Hello, Ida!,How are you this morning then, hey?,These flies are a pain, aren't they?,I'm going to give you a drink of this stuff,Good girl.,Keep swallowing.,Try and get your rumen going a bit.,You're not happy, are you, hey?,You're not happy.,You're just not happy, are you?,You're not even chewing your cud.,Hello Mike.

White Boy (2017) - full transcript,"Now the subject of 1980's Detroit street folklore, then 17 year old Richard Wershe, Jr. was said to have run a vicious, sophisticated large-scale inner-city drug operation.

that time,,I really didn't know anything,about White Boy Rick.,[Scott] I didn't know,who Rick Wershe was.,I just knew,there was this caricature,,almost like,a comic book character,being splashed

is,,he wasn't a poser.,That's who he was.,He was a product,of his environment.,He was a white kid,that was brought up,his... basically, his whole life,around all black people.,A lot of the DPD,that were working in the Detroit,drug scene at that time,,knew Rick was a race traitor.,They did not like the fact,that he talked black,,that he acted black,,that he dated black women,,and definitely didn't like,14 to 15-year-old kids,rolling around in BMWs,,and flashing cash wads,that equal more,than their entire paycheck,for the whole year.,Half million a week.,Two million dollars a

then she heard,about the Curry Brothers,and what we was into,in our life,,so we started dating.,[Johnny] And then,,the next thing you know,,we was married.,I just find it crazy,that he had a protection detail,of police officers,guarding his drug dealer niece.,[Scott] Including Jimmy Harris,,who was Mayor Coleman Young's,head of security.,They were specifically,instructed,not to intervene,in this interactions,and in these transactions.,One time, I got picked up by,,uh, one of the police officers.,He knew I had something,in the car.,He's seen it on the backseat.,He said, ""Go ahead,and go about your way.,You want me to escort you in,or something like that?"",So, I was fine.,'Cause they really never,messed with me too tough.,Their only job,was to follow around Cathy Curry,and prevent her from harm.,It was a slippery slope,,I think, for...,for these people.,They went downhill,,uh, very, very fast.,It was wide open,for greedy people.,And cops is just greedy,as we are.,If they got debts and so forth,,they're gonna turn to crooks.,Everybody, every police officer,,down at 1300 was crooked.,[Johnny] When I was down there,,I walked there like...,Shit, I did bad as

how you doing?,Where the [bleep],you've been, Foley?,[Kevin] In Detroit,,everybody knew Gil Hill,,they wanted to talk to Gil Hill,and be around Gil Hill.,He was probably,the biggest celebrity,in the city of Detroit,at the time.,Gil Hill, to me, was a lot more,than the Beverly Hills Cop,that you see on TV.,[William],He actually trained me.,He actually taught me,the ins and outs,of investigations,and interrogations.,[interviewer],Was Gil Hill affiliated,with the drug world?,Affiliated?,Yeah, he was affiliated.,He basically got us,to stay away from certain people,that he wanted to protect.,He'd tell us, ""Hey, man,,don't be hitting this.,Don't do this and that.,'Cause if you made our list,,you was gonna be killed."",I have nothing bad,to say about Gil Hill.,[William],He wanted homicides closed.,And he wanted,to get some resolve,to the brutality,of taking another person's life.,[interviewer],So you're telling me that the,head of homicide came to you-,and asked who you've got on,your hit list?,Yeah.,Gil.,As Gil would say,,""Anybody else on your list?,I don't give a fuck."",That's not the Gil Hill,that I know.,That doesn't mean,that, of course,,people don't have dark sides.,'Cause I, too, believe,that all people have dark sides.,So we would have,to listen to Gil,because he gonna do us,a favor later.,In order for us,to get favors from him,,we got to do favors,for him as well,,one hand washes the other.,He was a guy,with quite a bit of cache.,He had, he had his eyes set,on the mayor's office himself.,[Scott],I think he viewed himself,as Coleman Young's successor.,One of the nation's,best-known mayors,,Coleman Young of Detroit,,is getting a kind of,national attention these days,that no politician wants.,[Scott] Coleman Young was,a notoriously corrupt mayor,that never got convicted,or indicted.,[reporter #7],The latest involves charges,that his police chief,stole from a fund set up,for undercover drug buys.,And who the [bleep],do you think you are,to come in here,and cross-examine me?,[Joe] He drew enormous animosity,from a number of white residents,who blamed him,for great social ills.,And I know a number of people,including a number of federal,and local,law enforcement figures,that thought that he was steeped,totally in corruption.,I don't buy that.,I think there are people,around him were.,[Scott] So, lots of members,of federal law enforcement,had a giant agenda,to go get Coleman Young.,And try to tie parts,of his administration,into the Curry organization.,[Kevin] Johnny and Leo Curry,were convicted,and did a plea agreement,for 20 years.,I did 14 years.,I got a 20-year sentence,,I did 14, and came out.,[Chris] And one day, I get a tip,that they were gonna raid,Cathy Volsan-Curry's townhouse.,The Feds go in there,,and guess who's in there,,in bed with Cathy Volsan-Curry?,Richard Wershe, Jr.,[Chris] Imagine my editors,asking me,,""What have you got going today?"",I said, ""Well,,an alleged notorious,17-year-old drug dealer,was caught in a raid,,sleeping with the niece,of the mayor,on a Friday afternoon."",That's a bad day,for the Mayor's Office.,[Scott] You had race,,you had drugs,,you had sex,,you had political intrigue,,you had police corruption.,So now, Rick Wershe,is dating Coleman Young's niece.,[Kevin] And that's a problem,for Coleman Young.,And it becomes a problem,for Rick Wershe.,[Chris] Wershe was busted,for possessing eight kilos,of cocaine.,The charge which now has him,serving a life sentence.,You're not trying,to tell me that...,you're an angel,,that you never did,anything wrong, right?,I've been involved,in wrongdoing,,but I don't feel I did anything,to receive a life sentence.,[Herm] The 650-Lifer Law,that, uh, Wershe,was convicted under,,uh, was repealed in 1998.,[Ralph] So the Supreme Court,of the State of Michigan said,,""That constitutes cruel,and unusual punishment,,so you can't sentence people,to life without parole,for a non-violent crime.,[low unnerving music],[Gregg] But to be incarcerated,for 28 years,,he's now a grandfather.,[Steve],And everybody kinda recognized,it was a fool's errand,from the beginning.,Just like almost all,tough on crime things,turned out to be,a fool's errand.,Until the law was changed,,I don't think they caught one,,not one large-scale drug dealer.,[Chris] Were you ever,a cocaine kingpin?,[Gregg] And then in the press,,they come out and say,,""Drug kingpin White Boy Rick."",Kingpin of what?,Who?,He didn't have a drug gang,,he didn't have crack houses.,-[Chris] You ever kill anyone?,-No.,-Ever ordered anyone killed?,-No.,[Gregg] I'm sorry to tell you,,that the legend,of White Boy Rick,is just not true.,[Chris] Why would a juvenile,,non-violent drug offender,be kept in prison,beyond 29 years?,[Johnny] I did way more than he,could possibly ever had done,to get that kind of a sentence.,Third world countries,don't incarcerate like this.,[Chris] How does a 16,or 17-year-old kid,,Richard Wershe, Jr.,,how does he get connected,to the Curry family?,[Wershe],Here's the truth.,At the age of 14,,I was recruited by the FBI-,to become an informant.,[foreboding music],[Herm] It's a convoluted story.,So when I met, uh,,Richard Wershe, Sr.,,he had been opened up,as an informant,and operated, uh,,for a period of time,by two other agents.,He was a gun dealer,,uh, he was an entrepreneur.,There was no end,to what he was doing.,If he was in one thing,,he was always dabbling,in the next.,[Darlene],But he was very brilliant,,he invented a lot of things.,And I think he probably held,more patents,than anyone,in the state of Michigan.,I think he also had a business,,where he would illegally,sell guns on the black market.,And help people get permits.,He even sold silencers.,He could get you anything.,He could get you grenades.,[Scott] And then, kind of played,both ends of the game,,he would then divulge,who he was selling,these guns to, to the FBI.,At the top of the list,of their targets,is Johnny Curry,and the Curry gang.,[Herm] So the first time,I met Wershe, Sr.,Uh, it was at a McDonald's,on the west side of Detroit.,And, uh, when I walked,into the restaurant,,and after introductions,were made,,I noticed, uh, he's got,this young kid with him.,It appeared to me,to be 15 or so.,And when we got talking about,the Curry, uh,,drug investigation,,I noticed the father,would defer to the son.,[Wershe],My dad didn't really know,who these people were.,[Herm] And pretty soon,,it became apparent to me,that really, the kid is somehow,the real source,of the information.,[Wershe],And I kind of interjected and,told them who they were-,and recognized them from,the neighborhood.,I just didn't feel comfortable,with it.,I didn't think,it was appropriate.,But I wanted to keep,the channels,of communication open.,[Scott] I believe Richard,himself, quickly realized,that the target for this,was big game.,[Herm] He was using his son,to get paid.,It's not the role of a father,to do something like that.,[sirens blaring],[Scott] And this was something,that I think,started off as one thing,,and ended as another thing.,It started off where they would,,you know, sometimes pick Rick up,and they drive him,through the neighborhood.,And they say, ""Rick, tell us,who this guy is.,Tell us what that spot is.,What's that spot?"",[Kevin],So here's this 14-year-old kid,getting paid money,to inform on narcotics dealers,in the city of Detroit.,In the short time he was,an informant for the police,,he collected about $35,000,from law enforcement.,[Wershe],I went shopping, I bought stuff.,I bought a car when I was,15 years old.,It's funny to me how people,always talk about,what criminals will do,to make a dollar.,But, you know,,on the same regard,,you got to look,at what the FBI will do,to make an arrest.,[Scott],He was actually instructed,to infiltrate,the Curry Boys gang.,And start hanging out,with the Currys,,pretending that you wanna,learn the drug game,to start making controlled buys.,We had started letting him do,little errands,and then he started knowing,a few people that...,you figured that,when a white boy sells it,,the dope is good or whatever.,You know, so he started,doing his thing.,He didn't play,a really major role.,Nobody would mess,with him, though,,because they knew,he was coming from us, so.,[Scott] You know,,within a couple of months,,Rick is right by,Johnny Curry's side.,And has become a protégé,of Johnny Curry's.,I don't think anybody realized,that Rick would be able,to do that.,Let alone, do it so quickly.,[interviewer] And were they able,to make any arrests,out of your information?,[Wershe],Oh, yeah. Numerous.,[policeman] Go, go, go!,-Police!,-[thudding],[Kevin] When Rick would say,,""Hey, the dope's coming,to this house,"",the dope would come,to that house.,The police would make a raid,,they would confiscate,the drugs and money,,and, uh,,they would be successful.,[Wershe],Yeah I believe in one time-,in '85 I think it's-,eleven or thirteen in one day.,[Herm],You know, the whole business,of operating informants,,it's a cat and mouse game.,And just because somebody,has an informant,designated as the handler,for the informant,,doesn't preclude that informant,from being utilized,by other agencies,,Such as the Detroit,Police Department.,[Gregg] Uh, we had DEA involved,,the FBI involved.,We had United States Customs,,Michigan State Police,,we had Detroit Police.,That's actually,what was going on.,[Herm] The Detroit Police,Department officers,were also using, uh, this kid,in undercover capacity.,Uh, using him to make buys,,undercover buys.,[Scott] He's going,in unmarked police cars,,uh, at night, with the police.,Driving around,,identifying people,at certain clubs.,And he ain't getting home,till three in the morning.,And he's got to wake up at 7:00,to go to school.,[Wershe],I mean they weren't saying,,""Oh, quit school."",But they were saying-,you know,,""we need you to do this."",And I'd say,""well I've got school tomorrow."",And they said,""so what, we still""-,you know,,""go down to this club for us."",""You're wasting too much time,in Math class.,You need to be,on the street for us,,getting us information."",[car whooshing],[Scott] At some point,,as the fall progressed in 1984,,Johnny Curry,was given information,that Rick Wershe,was an informant.,Rick Wershe was giving,the Feds information,and people were getting busted.,So they knew somebody,was, was leaking information,,and they would have meetings,,talking about who,the informant might be.,[Scott] There were a lot,of people on the street,that believed that Johnny Curry,ordered Rick Wershe's murder.,So I remember being at the home,that my boyfriend and I shared,,and he said,,""Here comes your dad."",And I said,,""Tell him I'm not here."",[Dawn] And I was standing,in the bedroom,listening to him talk to my dad,at the front door,and my dad said,,""Tell her,,her brother's been shot."",And right then,,I fell to the floor.,I got in the car with my dad,and we went to the hospital.,Rick was with a, uh,,another Curry lieutenant,,who was a couple years,older than him.,[Wershe],We were in the house,Approximately five minutes.,We were both,skipping school that day.,He went upstairs.,[Scott],And after a couple of minutes,,says, ""Hey, Rick.,Come over here.,Come to the stairs."",[Wershe],As soon as I hit the,top of the stairs,he comes out of the bedroom,,shoots me in the stomach.,[Dawn],He was shot at close range,with a .357 magnum.,Went in the front, out the back,,blew his large intestine,in half.,[Wershe],I believe I rolled down,the stairs.,I was asking them to call 911.,He wouldn't call 911-,he was in a panic.,By the grace of God his,girlfriend walked in the house.,And she's the one,that called 911.,The guy that shot me- his older,brother and a friend of his were,putting me in the car.,I don't know if they were going,to take me to a hospital or take,me somewhere and dump me.,Finally an ambulance showed up,and blocked them off and-,told them to give me,to them and-,basically that ambulance ride,saved my life.,[Johnny] I had nothing to do,with his getting shot.,If an agent said it,or whoever said it,,a police officer,,whoever said it,,they're way out of order, then.,Rick's family,and the task force all arrived,in the waiting room,of the hospital.,There's a physical altercation,between Richard,and the FBI handlers.,[Scott] Richard blames them,for getting his son shot,and, at that time,,thinking he might die.,The task force were kind of,huddled by the snack machines.,They had realized,that if he died,,the fact that they had been,using a 14-year-old kid,to infiltrate druggings,was gonna come to the surface,and it would be a scandal,of all scandals.,The surgeon, Dr. Bowles,,that performed surgery,and saved Rick's life,sat next to his bedside.,I believe it was for ten,or twelve hours.,Because he didn't think,he was gonna make it.,But he did, thank god.,I really honestly believe,this is a turning point.,Because he could've,pumped the brakes.,He could've said,,""You know what? This is crazy.,We almost got this kid killed.,We need to stop everything,right now,and just do this, you know,,by the book."",[Scott] But, instead,,members of that task force,came with a conclusion,this would increase,his credibility.,[Wershe],The police told me to say the,shooting was an acident-,because it was the best way to,sweep it under the rug-,and I could continue to work for,them if I said it was an,accident.,We're gonna push it,into high gear.,[Scott] We're gonna send him,back in to the Curry gang,and if there was any belief,that he was an informant before,,that belief was gonna go,out the window,because if he was a snitch,,Johnny Curry would be,in handcuffs right now.,So, by the mere fact,of him going back,to his old neighborhood,,it built up his reputation,as a drug dealer,,uh, not an informant.,It almost helped him,in that regard.,[Scott] During Rick's recovery,,Johnny Curry called him,and, you know, said,,""Where have you been?,What's going on?"",Eventually, Rick met him,and was kinda like,confronted him.,""You thought I was an informant.,You had me shot."",And Johnny denied it.,Now, he might've mentioned it.,I don't know.,I had nothing to do with it.,[Scott],But from that point forward,,Rick was in tighter than ever.,[funky music],[commentator] And we're live,from Caesars Palace,in Las Vegas, Nevada.,Where Top Rank presents,World Championship Boxing.,[Herm] Johnny Curry,and his entourage,had gone to Las Vegas,to the Hearns-Hagler fight.,[announcer] Fighting out,of Detroit, Michigan...,[Scott] Tommy Hearns who was,Detroit's favorite son,in the boxing game at that time,,was facing off against,""Marvelous"" Marvin Hagler.,And all of the major,urban drug dealers of Detroit,went to the fight.,[Kevin] And this was,the golden era of boxing.,The Tommy Hearns-,Marvin Hagler fight,was all anybody,was talking about in sports.,[Scott] Tommy Hearns grew up,and socialized,with a lot of the black,drug dealers in the era.,And the kind of joke was,,last guy in Detroit,turn off the lights.,[crowd cheering],[Wershe],I was asked to go out there and-,get information about some,people that were-,involved in the drug trade-,and their corrections and-,how the drugs were coming in,and-,just basically as much intel as,I could from out there.,I was given a fake ID.,I was 15 at the time- the ID,made me 21 years old.,So, they gave him money,,they gave him false ID,,and they set him up in a casino.,[Ralph] This is insanity.,[Wershe],There's an FBI report detailing,that and it shows-,I think they gave me-,like $1,500-,on a receipt and then I think,they gave me like another-,thousand or 1,500 bucks for,pocket money.,[Scott],While they're at the fight,,Johnny Curry and his entourage's,reservations and fight tickets,mysteriously disappear.,Or maybe disappear,is the wrong word.,They never really existed,to start.,[Scott] Johnny had reached out,to a member of his crew,by a guy of a name of Leon Lucas,and him and Johnny,had kinda gotten into a beef,over drugs and money,that had been,confiscated in a raid.,Johnny Curry,held him responsible,for the drugs and money.,[Scott] And Leon said,,""Let me start,to try to make it up for you.,I will provide you,hotel arrangements,and tickets,for the Hagler-Hearns fight.,Now, he assured Johnny Curry,that it would all,be taken care of.,Well, when Curry,and his posse got out there,,nothing was handled,,nothing was taken care of.,[Herm] And when he,got back to Detroit,,some of his lieutenants,not at the direction,of Johnny Curry himself,,but some of his lieutenants,went over to Leon Lucas' house,in an effort to intimidate him.,What those individuals,that went there decided to do,was to shoot the place up,in a drive-by shooting.,Unfortunately, for them,,Leon Lucas isn't there.,[911 operator],[911 operator],[caller],[911 operator],[Kevin] And in the process,,Leon's nephew, Damion Lucas,,who was 13-years old,,and was living with him,,was shot and killed.,And this becomes,a very hot topic,in law enforcement.,[Scott] On the news,,""13-year-old Killed,in Drive-by."",[Herm],You know, I heard Johnny Curry,,uh, on wiretaps.,Uh, shortly after we got,the authority to tap his phone.,And he was lamenting,,whoever he was talking with,,that, ""You know, those guys,shouldn't have gone over there.,I told them don't go,over there."",He was sorry that this whole,thing had taken place.,Probably because it was,bringing a lot of heat,on him, uh,,and his drug organization.,[somber music],Rick Wershe comes back,into play in this whole story.,And that Rick says,he was, uh, listening in on,a phone conversation,over a speakerphone,,and he heard Johnny Curry,talking to Gil Hill.,[Wershe],And that's when I found out that,Gil Hill was responsible for,covering up the kid's murder.,Johnny placed a call to Gil, put,it on speaker-,we were riding around in,Johnny's BMW.,Basically Gil told him,everything that was going on,,and-,you know- that he had it under,control, and that he would be in,touch-,not to worry about anything.,He had already been to meet with,Gil and-,he said he gave Gil ten grand to,cover up the kid's murder.,This information made him,incredibly dangerous,to a lot of people.,Johnny Curry told this to me,while he was incarcerated,at the Texarkana,Federal Correctional Facility,in Texas.,[Herm] So, ultimately,,what happened,is the, uh,,Detroit Police Department,,under the direction of Gil Hill,,uh, framed, basically,,an innocent man, LaKeas Davis.,I had information.,Part of it was,from Richard Wershe, Jr.,,and part it was from,the wiretaps that we had,that strongly suggested,that they had the wrong guy,locked up.,And he's facing a life term.,[Nate] Well, sometime,he had tell us,to put the gun,in somebody's car.,One of our enemies.,And then he had the police,pull up on them,and said, ""Wait, wait.,Is that a gun hanging out,on your seat?"",Well, the people don't know,that we just slipped the gun,in their car.,[laughter],Same way we did,with a pot of drugs.,He used to tell us to set,people up with drug bust too.,That's the way they get busses.,[Gregg] Subsequently,,I was ordered,by my special agent in charge,to gather all,of the information that we had,with regards to,the Damion Lucas murder,and take it directly,to Chief Hart,of the Detroit,Police Department.,I did so and nothing,ever occurred.,To this day, it's still,an open investigation.,[Herm] In fact, LaKeas Davis,remained in jail,was facing a trial.,And so I made sure,Davis' defense attorney,got the information,that he needed,to get him exonerated.,Ultimately, that resulted,in me being subpoenaed,to state court.,And where demands were met on me,to reveal the source,of the information.,Well, it became,very touch-and-go,because there would be,extreme retaliation,against the Wershe family.,And so I refused to do it.,And, um, I was threatened,with contempt of court.,Ultimately, they dismissed,the case against LaKeas Davis,and they freed him,at that point.,[Scott] And Gil Hill,was investigated,for his role,in taking a possible payoff,and possibly,burying these charges.,He was never charged.,And when Gil Hill ran for mayor,,this case came up,and was a detriment,to his campaign.,At that point, I didn't realize,to, uh, what extent,the corruption had spread,throughout,the police department.,[Gregg] When we did the raid,on Cathy Volsan-Curry's house,which was in June of 1987,,we found a laminated card,exactly like this one,,holding the personal,and confidential information,from Gil Hill and Jimmy Harris,which ended up being,the beginning of all the rumors,that we had heard,with regards to,the funneling of information,from the Detroit,Police Department,to the Curry organization.,So was that uncommon for Cathy,to have that kind of access?,She had access,to anything she wanted.,[Chris] Like what?,Police reports,,surveillance reports,,whatever you wanted.,[Chris] On Johnny?,Johnny, myself,,other people,who needed this stuff.,[Chris] So, if she said,to Sgt. Jimmy Harris,,""I need to know what,the narcotics cops are doing,on Rick, on Johnny,,on anybody else,"",he would flip them to her?,No problem.,[Herm] The matter,of the Damion Lucas murder,was never resolved.,I knew who did it,and, but, uh, proving it,is something else.,[Wershe] Truthfully I wish I,never woulda got roped into the,Damion Lucas thing, because-,I didn't know 30 years later it,would still be affecting my,life.,[ominous music],Well, I was, uh, told,to kill White Boy Rick.,We heard that he was telling.,So, they say,,""We gotta kill that white boy."",[Todd] My career is finished.,But I promise you,,I won't go down alone.,[Nate] I know after he did, uh,,Beverly Hill Cops and all that,,he was trying to stay away,from everybody.,But he would meet you somewhere,as long as he feel he was safe.,Like he would meet you out,at The Island in Waterfront.,But, yeah, uh...,He said that basically,,he wants us to make sure,that we kill White Boy Rick.,Make sure that boy is dead.,But we gotta make sure that,it don't lead back to no one.,I said, ""Well, you know me.,All my hits don't lead back,to no one."",[Scott] Rick had got in deeper,and had risen higher,than anyone ever thought,he could.,[Wershe] At some point these,guys said-,sooner or later something's,going to go bad-,and we're going to be held,accountable.,[Ralph] They don't debrief him.,They don't send him,to a boarding school,where he can get over,what they've just,subjected him to.,They turn him loose,on the streets.,[Wershe] It wasn't like they,ever said-,""Rick, stop selling drugs."",""Rick, stop buying drugs."",One day they just never called,again-,and that's how we broke ties.,He wasn't gonna go,back to school.,He knew the drug trade.,So, he became a drug dealer.,[Wershe] I became addicted to,the lifestyle.,I became addicted to the money.,I became addicted to the women.,I became addicted to that life.,[Scott] The only difference was,,you know, he wasn't getting,a government stipend.,They had gleaned enough,information and intelligence,from him regarding,the Curry gang,that the indictment,was on the horizon.,The indictment would drop,within a couple months.,[Kevin] Rick will tell you that,it wasn't the smartest thing,to do, to date the wife,of a man you put in prison,or help put in prison.,Uh, but it happened.,I still wouldn't hold nothing,against that.,She was getting high.,What can you say, so...,[Wershe] I was a 17 year old,kid- I was having fun.,To be honest, dating her back,then was like-,dating a movie star or,something.,I remember one time,,back in those days,,I had a '63 black,Corvette convertible,with red interior.,[Chris] And I'm driving it,downtown.,Who comes driving by?,Rick Wershe and his friends.,And I forget what kind of car,but it was relatively,new and nice.,""Hey, Chris. What's going on?"",-[car whooshes],- You speed off.,He was enjoying,the celebrity moment.,He was a kid.,And he was famous for all,the wrong reasons,but he was living the life.,But I knew that was,White Boy Rick's ride.,[Nate] So we followed him.,I speeded up,trying to get to him.,[Wershe] Me and Roy were sitting,at a stoplight in a car-,and I happened to look over my,shoulder and I seen a van,pulling up.,And I saw the door sliding-,it was like cracked open.,And I told Roy, I said, ""Roy,,run the light!"",We stopped.,That side door pulled open.,[Nate],Who's siting in the chair?,[imitates gun firing, jamming],""Man, hand me,another gun,"" I said.,I think we better reach,up in the...,By that time,,they had speeded off.,[Wershe] I mean they got shots,off- the car was hit.,That's the only reason why,he was still alive.,That MAC jammed on us.,[Wershe] I had friends that were,murdered.,To be honest, you're a kid and,you don't realize-,everyday that you were playing,with fire-,that you could walk out your,door one day and your life would,be over.,[ominous music],[Ralph] And in that period,of time,,he became what is known,as a ""wait man."",As a wait man,,he had a line of credit,with some drug importers,in Miami.,He brought a lot of drugs,into Detroit,in a very short period of time.,He was not a drug dealer,for very long, ,but he was nowhere near,the big-time drug dealers.,[Johnny] From a scale,to one to ten,,I'm a ten,,I'd say he was about a two.,Rick was nowhere near me.,Guys like the Chambers,or guys like the Currys,they controlled whole sections,of the city.,Rick didn't control anything.,I used to say,,""Where did they...,Where is they getting,this stuff from?,I guess this Chris Hansen guy.,I don't know."",I never set out,to make Rick look like,a bigger drug dealer,than he was.,[Chris] Were there,some exaggerations?,Perhaps.,[Scott] There were,seeds of truth,to what they were saying.,He was socializing with all,of the major players,,so it was hard for the media,to divorce that.,You know, whether he was,a drug kingpin,,a drug lord, a drug prince,,a drug prodigy,,he was a 17-year-old kid,dealing multi-kilos of dope,and very few adults do that.,Rick couldn't deal,with a lot of guys...,A lot of people,that I've dealt with,,Rick couldn't even see them.,Johnny and his brother,,and his people,,they were grown men.,These are grown men.,[Steve] And this was a kid.,That's the difference.,A 17-year-old white kid?,It was impossible for him,to have been,what people have pretended,that he was.,[Wershe] It wasn't like I went,out and said-,I want to become this big drug,dealer and-,want everyone in the state of,Michigan to know me.,I was led down this path by law,enforcement.,I think about every day if I,would have walked away.,I was a kid. I was stupid.,So, when you look at it,at the end of the day,,you know, law enforcement,created, almost,a perfect criminal.,[Scott] And law enforcement,created the perfect persona,,a perfect character,for the local news,,for the local media,,and they ate it up.,I covered it a lot.,Rick will say,I had him on TV every day.,Obviously, that's not true.,He's just saying that,to make a point.,They convicted me,through the media,,through the papers.,I was the public enemy,number one,and they said stuff,that was totally untrue.,Were there stories about him,ordering hits on people,that weren't true,floating around?,Absolutely. I heard them.,But they never,prosecuted him for it.,My grandfather who was,a judge in Detroit,at the time of Mr. Wershe's case,had presided over his case,for a brief period of time.,[Dana] And he calls him,,""Worse than a mass murderer,"",and gave him,a one-million-dollar bond.,It was the highest bond,my grandfather had ever set,for any defendant.,If you have so much evidence,that he's been involved,in a drug hit,,bring a case.,If not,,rumors don't count in court.,On May 23rd, 1987,,Rick Wershe and a man,named Roy Grissom,were arrested driving,down Hampshire near Dickerson.,[Ralph] It ended with his arrest,which is kind of,an interesting story,because it was probably a setup.,[Scott] Rick, at this point,,has hooked up,with two Colombian,wholesale cocaine dealers,in Miami.,They would send kilos up,to Detroit in trailers.,He got a shipment. I believe,,it was an 18-kilo shipment.,They drop off ten kilos,of cocaine to a customer,and they have a pile of cash,in the car.,And they passed a police car,that was just, um,,routine traffic duty.,And I believe he actually waved,at the police officer,because he knew him.,[Kevin] They're driving home.,They get pulled over.,Allegedly for going through,a stop sign.,[Scott] At this point,,there's a bunch of people,on the porch,including Rick's sister, Dawn.,And we watched it all unfold.,He said, ""Okay, guys,,what's going on?"",And they said,,""You're under arrest."",And he said, ""For what?"",And they said,,""Possession of drugs."",And he told them,,""I don't have any drugs."",And they said they were,in the car.,He said, ""Search it."",One of the police officers,reaches into the back of the car,and pulls out a bag,with the cash.,So my dad ran out there,and grabbed the bag of money.,Officers say a tussle started.,A fight almost between Wershe,,Grissom, and the officers.,Investigators say,that Wershe took off running.,[Scott] About 25 minutes,,a half-hour later,,the police find him,and they roughed him up,pretty good.,To the point where he had,to go to the hospital.,So, the next three,or four hours,,the police are combing,the neighborhood,looking for drugs.,They got an anonymous tip.,[Chris] Later,,more police arrived,and eventually they found,a box containing,eight kilos of cocaine,under this back porch,,a block away,from the traffic stop.,[Wershe],I was responsible for those,drugs. I had to pay the people,in Miami for those drugs.,[Kevin] Rick believes,that it was a setup.,That they were watching him,and they knew,he would have drugs or money.,And they say that when he,ran out of the car,,he hid the cocaine,underneath a porch,and continued to run away.,And he's charged,with that crime.,The attorney that was,representing him at the time,was an attorney,by the name of William Bufalino.,And he brought motions,to suppress the evidence.,[Ralph] Shortly thereafter,,Coleman Young's niece told Rick,,""Everything will be okay,but you need to get,different attorneys."",[Kevin] They decided,that they needed,an African-American attorney.,And that it would look better,to the jury.,[Ralph] ""Hire Ed Bell,and Sam Gardner,and everything will be okay."",When they went forward,,they changed their strategy.,They, they decided,not to heavily pursue the idea,that these drugs,where not Rick's.,Fatal mistake.,[Wershe],Sam Gardner was Coleman Young's,lawyer at the time, and-,the only reason they were,brought in-,was to watch me.,It wasn't to help me.,Basically, every time I went,to see him, he just told me,,""I had nothing to worry about.,Things were looking good."",I was told at one time,that I wouldn't go to trial.,He didn't think,that we would go to trial.,Before they went to trial,,his trial attorneys agreed,to withdraw all,the pretrial motions.,[Ralph] They agreed not to admit,any evidence,in front of the jury,that he had been working,for the government,since he was 14.,So, the jury never heard that.,[Wershe],Basically I think the fix was,in-,and Coleman didn't want me on,the streets anymore.,So them being my attorneys-,I think they tanked the case.,[Steve] I think it was,like a whirlwind,that just kind of swept them up.,'Cause the phone conversation,I remember having with him,,he was kind of baffled,by his notoriety.,And then that time,when I saw him,,you know,,he's waiting on his jury,and all these assholes,are around him.,All of them wanted him,to be convicted,I'm sure, that's why,they showed up.,Rick took the nickname,and ran with it.,I mean, he didn't have,to wear the fur coats.,He didn't have,to show up to trial,with a whole crew of little kids,wearing beepers and gold chains.,He came to court,like a drug dealer.,I said, ""Rick, if those jurors,see all these little crooks,running around with you,,you're dead."",We was told,to show up down there,with our expensive cars,,jewelry,,and just get in front,of the news.,[Nate] These all his workers.,Kingpin is on trial.,Drug lord is on trial.,And his friends down here,trying to free him.,Of course, it hurt him. There's,no doubt about it, it hurt him.,Same police officers,paid us to do that.,[Nate] Ain't nobody ever,heard of him being no drug lord,until they print that shit,in the paper.,Where the hell,was he a kingpin of?,Us blacks?,Oh, hell no.,We made it seem like that,,but he wasn't.,They had this newspaper article,where they actually listed him,as the leader,of the Best Friends gang.,Which is crazy, you know.,Best Friends were like,this hit gang,that had over a hundred murders.,It's just incredible and crazy.,[Joe] We had to rely,on law enforcement.,We saw the documents.,We saw them firsthand.,They were shared with us,and we did our best to vet them.,But we were certainly,not making stuff up,or fabricating.,There was enough going on,to keep us all busy,with crazy-enough stories.,You had characters,like Maserati Rick,who survived,an assassination attempt,and then was murdered,in his hospital bed.,And in the nightstand,was a pistol,and a crucifix,and, uh, rosary beads.,He was buried in,a Mercedes-Benz coffin.,So you didn't have,to make stuff up.,But that's how the cops,had it set up.,And that's how they listed him,and that's how we reported it.,And that's how we sourced it,in the story,and the graphic illustrations,,that this was based,on law enforcement documents,and sources.,It was a political move.,[Nate] That's why they,could put him away forever.,[Wershe],Nate was showing up down there-,which we saw Nate there- to try,and do some harm to me.,[Nate] I was trying to shoot him,out at the courthouse.,We had the van,already parked up on Gratiot.,I already had the scope,and everything scoped in,,but, at that point,,they walked him underneath,into the courthouse.,""What do you mean,he in the courtroom?"",They said, ""Yeah,,he in the courtroom."",[Wershe],Of course we were a little more,careful and-,when we left the,courthouse, or where we parked,the car, or whatever.,He wasn't,there to wish me well at trial.,And he was convicted,and, after that, it was easy.,[Ralph] You're going to jail.,You're never gonna see,the light of day.,[foreboding music],[Herm] This operation,was called Operation Backbone.,The reason I named it Backbone,,I figured you need some backbone,to work this case, you know.,At that time,,it was the most significant,police corruption investigation,in the state of Michigan.,The objective was,I knew through,the Curry investigation,and the Damion Lucas homicide,that that investigation,was partly compromised.,And I knew that there were,corrupt police officers,involved in this thing.,So, that was the objective,,to get these corrupt cops.,[Ralph] And he called,out of the blue,and I said,,""What's going on, Rick?"",He said, ""Well, the FBI is here,and they want me to help them.,They have said,that they will help me,if I help them."",""But if you cooperate,on this undercover project,and everything works fine,,the best I can do is,,maybe, take you out,of the state custody,and put you in the Federal,Witness Protection Program,in a federal facility,with other informants.,And it might just be,a better situation.,And if you ever,become eligible for parole,,I'll come back,and testify for you.,I'll tell them what you did."",He said, ""You know what?"",We shook hands and that,was the agreement we made.,And the Feds, during that time,,were chasing Coleman Young hard.,They wanted to bring down,the mayor of Detroit.,[Wershe],The FBI wanted to use my,relationship with Cathy-,to target the mayor-,as well as police corruption,within the city of Detroit.,They were targetting Willie,Volson.,He was married to the mayor's,sister.,He was Cathy's father of course,and-,everyone knew that Willie had,pull-,throughout the city of Detroit.,The other target of operation,was Jimmy Harris.,He was a high ranking Detroit,police official.,He did whatever mayor Young told,him to do.,He covered up the thinks that,the mayor's family did.,To my knowledge, for the right,price-,they were willing to protect,drug shipments-,from anywhere, I mean-,if it was in the city of Detroit,and they could make a buck off,of it-,they were willing to provide,that police protection.,[Herm] So, I got,Rick Wershe's sister, Dawn,,to cooperate with me as well.,And she had a relationship,with Cathy.,I had an agent,by the name of Mike Castro,who had served extensively,in the Caribbean,and knew the Caribbean,pretty well.,[Wershe],I introduced Mike Castro- who,was the undercover FBI agent-,to Cathy. He posed as my,supplier from Miami.,And me knowing Cathy and her,family- how greedy they were-,I knew Cathy would cut into,him-,and that's exactly what,happened.,[Herm] We arranged a dinner,with Wershe's sister,,Cathy Volsan-Curry,,and Mike Castro.,Which I attended,,but I was off to the side,and it was recorded.,So, during that conversation,,uh, Cathy was just enamored,with the prospect,of getting back,into the cocaine business,and so forth.,Uh, her eyes lit up.,And at that point, she offered,her police assistance.,[FBI Agent],So basically we're businessmen-,we're in the drug business.,[Herm] We invited Willie Volsan,and James Harris,down to Florida.,Had an undercover yacht.,[Herm] Sat down there,,and on videotape,,and negotiated the deal.,[FBI Agent] We'd like to-,fly something in.,We're going to look like,businessmen delivering packages.,[James] Okay.,- Only us and you will know it's,drugs.,No one else is going to know,anything.,[Harris],Okay.,[FBI Agent],We're going to probably-,ship up in the plane around 100,keys.,- You provide protection-,and protection from the police.,Think you can handle that?,[Harris],What you're talking about is no,problem.,[FBI Agent],Right.,[Harris],I've got three Detroit police,officers myself- it's cool.,[FBI Agent],Okay.,[FBI Agent],Alright.,[Harris],These people have been with me.,[FBI Agent],You can trust them.,We'll have out equipment, our,van or whatever-,load it up.,Just like the money laundering,operation- you escort us away,from the airport-,out on the highway and-,sayonara!,- For a successful mission and,a-,a good escape and all of that-,40-50 grand?,So do we got a deal?,[Volson & Harris],Yep.,[James],We go. We go.,[FBI Agent],Partners in crime brother!,- Here we go.,[Chris] Willie and Cathy,along with Detroit Police,Sergeant Jimmy Harris,were charged last month,in an FBI corruption case,alleging that police officers,took payoffs,to protect drug,and drug money shipments,coming into the city,in Metro Airport.,[Wershe],Any other mayor would have been,glad to have corruption out of,their police department.,Unless your brother-in-law is,the head of the corruption.,And then this guy goes on to,call me a stool pigeon.,That's like an old gangster term,for a rat.,Did that put your life,in danger,,having Coleman Young,call you a stool pigeon?,[Wershe],Oh, there's no doubt about it.,[Herm] Eighteen,corrupt police officers,and politicians,,as a result,of Wershe's direct involvement,in this thing, went to prison.,[Herm] And without,White Boy Rick,or Richard Wershe, Jr.,it's I think he'd prefer,to be called at this point,,that never would have happened.,And they haven't even,scratched the surface.,The corruption runs so deep,in there it's...,[Wershe] It's insane, man.,[Chris],During the FBI investigation,,Hill met with Harris,,a longtime friend, Volsan,,and the undercover agent,posing as the drug dealer.,[Herm] Willie would, uh,,constantly brag,about his relationship,with Gil Hill.,[Herm] And so, toward,the end of the operation,,we wanted to see,if he'd actually set up,an introduction to Gil Hill,,and he did.,We got a wiretap authority,to install wiretaps,inside of Willie Volsan's car.,[Herm] And we arranged it,for both undercover agents,to meet with Gil Hill,and Willie Volsan,,and that happened.,During that conversation,,Mike Castro let it be known,that he was a money launderer,and they were drug dealers.,Uh, that plainly.,[Herm] It was my thought,that, uh, if Gil Hill,wanted to get up,and run out of that meeting,,so be it.,He's an innocent guy.,But if he stayed,,that meant something else.,And not only did he stay,,but he had a conversation,which was taped.,And in that conversation,,Gil Hill said he wanted,to get money,from Mike Castro.,I got authorization,to pay him the money,,$20,000.00.,The thing languished,,and it languished,,and it languished,before the bureaucrats,could make up their mind.,When they finally,made up their mind,,uh, the trail had cooled.,[Herm],I think Gil, at that point,,uh, being a smart guy,,he smelled a rat,and, and didn't take the bait,,so we lost an opportunity.,[Chris] But Hill refused,to get involved.,He says the entire probe,smacks of entrapment.,[Chris] It seems,like this upset you.,Tremendously.,Now, is he,this major criminal mastermind?,I don't think so.,Was he a guy who played fast,and loose, and...,Perhaps.,And maybe have crossed,the line a couple of times.,But try as they might,,and I know the Feds,who were chasing him,,trying their damndest.,These were solid,hardworking guys after him.,They were not dogging it.,If they could have caught him,,they would have. They didn't.,[Kevin] Reporters,were chasing Gil Hill,down the street,,asking him if he was involved,in taking bribes.,[Kevin] And that's very damaging,if you wanna be the next mayor,of the city of Detroit.,[Scott] Gil Hill ran for mayor,and lost,,but Gil Hill blames Rick,for him not becoming the mayor.,[Wershe],I think helping the FBI with,Operation Backbone-,was the biggest mistake of my,life.,Because it created enemies that-,I couldn't even imagine- I was a,kid.,I didn't think of the political,aspects of it.,There's still,a lot of angry people,in the city of Detroit,in positions of power.,[ominous music],In Michigan, you're supposed,to have an opportunity,to have a parole hearing,every five years.,Rick Wershe has only had,one parole hearing,in 28 years in prison.,That parole hearing was in 2003,,and it was a spectacle.,[dramatic music],[Ralph] When you're up,for parole,,what the parole board does,is they send letters out,to the original trial judge.,[Ralph] In Rick's case,,it was a judge,by the name of Thomas Jackson,who's recently retired.,And Judge Jackson wrote back,and he said,,""I have no problem with this,young man getting out.,He's served a long time,in jail."",They then send the letter,at the same time,to the prosecuting,attorney's office.,[Ralph] The chief prosecutor,was a fellow,by the name of Michael Duggan.,And Michael Duggan,is now the mayor,of the city of Detroit.,[Ralph] The first response,from that office was,,""We have no problem,with him getting out."",Two weeks later,,another letter comes,from that office saying,,""Disregard the first letter.,We don't want him out."",In the letter, which was,a multipage letter,,they were saying,that Richard Wershe, Jr.,was responsible for the downfall,of the city of Detroit.,Rick Wershe was involved,in cases as a juvenile,where the witnesses,just disappeared.,That this kid is so dangerous,that he should never be,let out of prison.,And it was signed,by Michael Duggan.,[Ralph] If you ask him today,,he'll tell you he doesn't,remember that letter,and he didn't remember,signing it.,If you look at the letter,,the name right,underneath Michael Duggan,is that of his chief assistant,,Samuel Gardner.,Rick's two defense attorneys,at the time he was convicted,was Samuel Gardner and Ed Bell,,who were law partners.,[Wershe],He wanted to keep me in prison,as long as he could.,I mean here's a guy that was my,lawyer-,and was the number two,prosecutor-,told me I had nothing to worry,about.,And then this letter that was-,so outlandish and crazy gets,sent to the parole board.,I think it proves that they,threw the case from the,beginning-,and that their ultimate goal was,to keep me in prison.,[Kevin] So I went over,to the hearing,,and, in, in the first day,of the hearing,,I heard federal agents say,that Rick Wershe,was very helpful.,Instrumental in bringing,down dirty cops,and other drug dealers,in Detroit,,and that they believed,he should be let out of prison,,that he should be paroled.,You come back the next day,,and it's a completely,different story.,The Wayne County,Prosecuting Attorney,brings in three or four,homicide detectives.,I was approached by Deputy Chief,Dennis Richardson,,and was told that I was gonna go,to the parole hearing.,The goal of the hearing,was to make sure,that he was not released.,That Richard Wershe,was considered to be dangerous.,They characterized him,as, uh, Al Capone.,[Ralph] And they start detailing,the collapse of the city.,And then I talked about,,in generalities,,the damage that drugs had did,to the city of Detroit.,- The story of all,of the homicides,,and all of the drugs,,and all of the murders.,- That was the extent,of my contact,with the parole board.,But the other members,of the police department,and, and law enforcement,that was there,went into generalities also.,[Ralph] And if you read it,,the transcript, carefully,,they just keep throwing,Rick Wershe, Jr.'s name in.,They never say,that he does this stuff.,It's fair that you could,have implied,that they knew,about Richard Wershe.,Because they slanted it,to whereas he was,to be considered dangerous,when they didn't know anything,at all about him.,They never even worked drugs.,And some of them,ended up in prison themselves.,In order to prepare,for the parole hearing,,I was given information,to review and look at,so that I can familiarize myself,with Richard Wershe.,They went to,the Detroit Free Press,and said,,""We need to have,all of the news articles,with regards to Rick Wershe,because we wanna review,a bunch of this information.,Well, now we know,that half of the stuff that's,in print wasn't true at all.,It was made up,by the news media.,Listening,to these police officers,say that Rick Wershe,was violent and dangerous,and should not be,let out of prison,was hard-hitting.,And it was powerful.,It was a powerful testimony.,You had some people,that testified,in favor of Rick Wershe,including Kid Rock,,the musician.,[Kevin] Kid Rock did not show up,with a big entourage.,He came by himself.,He drove himself,to that hearing,,and he told the parole board,very plainly,that, ""This could have been me,if the circumstances,were different,"",and that Rick Wershe,deserves to get out.,And he quietly went away.,[Kevin] But ultimately,,the story didn't play out,that way.,The police jumped on the fact,that Kid Rock was there,and they basically put out,the story line that,,""What? Is White Boy Rick,gonna get out of prison,and go be a roadie for Kid Rock?,[Kevin] There's a real recipe,for success.,Let's take this drug dealer,and put him,with a big-time rapper,,and let's see how well he does.,Let's see,if he's really reformed.,This is not gonna work."",And that played well.,It played well with the public,and I think it played,with the parole board.,[Herm] And, uh, the result,was they turned down his parole.,It was a sham.,There was absolutely no reason,for any of us to be there,to try to prevent him,from being released.,I voted to have,Rick Wershe released.,It made sense.,There was no reason,in this world,that he should still be there.,This whole thing,stinks to high heaven.,[Wershe],I think it goes back to Gil,Hill.,All roads lead back to him.,I mean-,there's someone or some thing,that's keeping me in prison and,it's not the crime that I,committed.,[wind howling],[Herm] So, uh, a couple of years,after the parole hearing, uh,,probably around 2005,,Wershe, Jr., uh,,was of course in, uh,,federal, uh, protective custody,,uh, witness protection program,doing his life sentence.,I became aware,that he was involved,,in a very minor way,,in an auto theft ring.,He became aware of the ability,to obtain a car for his mother.,Consisted of him making,some phone calls,on behalf of the people,that were actually involved,in the auto theft ring.,When the Wayne County,Prosecutor's Office found out,,they made phone calls,to the United States,Attorney's Office,down in Miami saying,,""You make sure he's indicted,and the full extent of the law,comes down on him."",[Wershe],I was told, ""You take a plea,bargain, or I am going to arrest,your mom and your sister."",So what do I do?,I took a plea bargain.,So he pled guilty,and got a five-year sentence.,[Scott] Ninety-nine-point-nine,percent of all other cases,,the five years,will run concurrently,with the life sentence,that he's under in Michigan.,But because Rick's Rick,,the sentence was ruled,to run consecutively.,If and when he's released here,,which I pray is soon,,he has to go to Florida,and finish out time.,[Scott] And if you look,at the guy's prison record,,with the exception,of that one incident,,he is someone,that is a model prisoner.,""He has remained misconduct-free,during his entire sentence,with the MDOC which started,in February 5th, 1988.,Mr. Wershe has maintained,steady employment,and has never been,a management problem for staff.,[Dana] He has,good communication skills,and interacts well with staff,and other inmates alike."",In my opinion,,that would show that Mr. Wershe,was a model prisoner.,[Dana] And there's no reason,that he should have been,denied parole for so long.,[somber music],[Dana] ""Now, based on my reading,of the briefs,,all parties agreed,that defendant's,original sentence,of life without the possibility,of parole,for a juvenile who committed,a non-violent offense,involving drugs,was unconstitutional.,The case law,over the last decade,has demanded,that we treat juveniles,constitutionally different,than adults.,That difference requires us,to consider the defendant's age,at the time the crime,was committed.,[Dana] Where,a defendant's sentence,violates the constitution,,recent case law holds,that remedy for that violation,is resentencing."",[Kevin] Suddenly in 2015,,Judge Dana Hathaway decided,that she wanted,to resentence Rick Wershe,and it was a major decision.,[Ralph] Uh, he's stunned.,I mean, you can see,in the courtroom, uh,,he, he doesn't know where to go.,I mean, he is just,almost in shock.,We need him out.,He's been in long enough.,I'm a bit overwhelmed,because I've only seen,my father in person,maybe two or three times,in my life,,so it was a difficult,relationship to know someone,your whole life and not really.,[Dawn] They wouldn't even,allow him out,for my dad's funeral.,When my dad was dying,of cancer, we, um...,We asked and they said, ""No.,It's too high,of a security risk."",[Wershe],I wold like to spread my dad's,ashes somewhere and-,visit my grandparents' grave.,I just wanna see him,,like I said,,and spend time with him,before I die.,[Wershe],My mother's not in good health,,I mean-,after twenty-nine years you,don't hit the ground running-,but I think I have a good,support team.,He's supposed to get out.,And if he doesn't get out,,I want you, news guys,,to be investigating,as to who in the hell,wants him in,and who has that kind of power,to keep him in.,Wershe will be back here,in two weeks,to hear the judge's sentence.,If it is the time served,,it's possible he could walk out,of here a free man.,[Kevin] It would definitely mean,that his time as a prisoner,is near its end.,[Kevin] Kym Worthy,objected to that.,She's the prosecutor,in Wayne County.,In 2015, she said,,""We believe the law says,that Rick Wershe,must stay in prison,until the parole board,releases him."",[Kevin] So as it stands,right now,,Rick Wershe,will not be resentenced.,[Dana] When Prosecutor Worthy,objected to my resentencing,,I was disappointed.,I didn't think that there was,a legitimate basis for it.,And then,when the Court of Appeals,sided with the prosecutor,,[stutters],I was disappointed again.,I thought that, uh, my opinion,had strong legal footing,given the fact,that his sentence was ultimately,an Eighth Amendment violation,and I thought the remedy,should have been resentencing.,[Wershe],Oh, I'm disappointed. I mean-,let down a little bit, but-,I expected it to be honest with,you.,After all this time in here you,don't believe you're doing to,get out of here-,until the day you walk out of,here.,[Kevin] Kym Worthy is one,of the main people,standing in his way,of becoming a free man.,And she's,made no public statement,over the years.,She's never given any indication,why she's so dead set,on Rick Wershe staying,in prison.,[Kevin],I've done dozens of stories,on the injustice of Rick Wershe,still being in prison.,And I've truly felt,that the stories I've done,should have been enough,for people,to do the right thing,,but that hasn't happened.,[Dana] His sentence,shocks the conscience.,How long he was in,shocks the conscience.,I'm not saying he was innocent,,but part our job is letting,the punishment fit the crime.,And here, it absolutely did not.,For a juvenile defendant,to never have his age,taken into consideration,was highly inappropriate,and inconsistent,with the case law,that's been evolving,for the past decade.,He's a juvenile,non-violent offender,who served 29 years.,He should be out.,He is a political prisoner.,[Scott] He is being held,against his will,by the politicians of Michigan,for crimes he never did!,There is a relationship,between the current,Wayne County prosecutor,and Gil Hill.,[Joe] From what I saw,,Kym Worthy and Gil Hill,had a professional,and political relationship.,[Herm] Uh, she,and Gil Hill worked together,especially when he was,,um, city council,,so they have a long history.,So I think,that's where the issue is.,Well, the city lost,a good one today.,Gilbert Hill,,or Gil as we knew him,,died today peacefully,with family by his side.,[reporter #8] He was a legendary,homicide detective in Detroit,and, of course, landed the role,of Eddie Murphy's,foul-mouthed boss,in Beverly Hills Cop.,[somber music],[Kevin] Two huge stories today.,First is statement,from Kym Worthy,that she gave exclusively,to the defenders.,Kym Worthy saying she is,going to reconsider her stance.,She may no longer object,to Wershe being locked up.,[Kevin] This decision,by Kym Worthy,coming the very same day,that a hitman says he was hired,by a police officer,to kill Rick Wershe,back in the '80s.,Maybe they need to step down,and let the boy out,before I start,really naming names,and they know who they are.,[Kevin] In that documentary,,I'm told that Nate Craft,is going to say,that former Mayor Coleman Young,and former City Council,President Gil Hill,went to great lengths,to make sure,that White Boy Rick Wershe,would stay in prison,for the rest of his life.,So, finally,,after all of this time,,Kym Worthy says she's not,going to stand,in Rick Wershe's way,,but she's not gonna do,anything to help him either.,[Kevin] She's going to leave,that up to the parole board.,[Gregg],Well, that's the problem,,is the parole board.,They believe whoever,is sitting there talking to them,and they never ask,any questions.,[Gregg] They just listen,to it all and then they vote.,And half the time,,they've listened,to the wrong information.,The Supreme Court,in, in the State of Michigan,needs to take a look at this,,or the governor,needs to pardon him.,Every time I've called,the Governor's Office,,I've been told by his Office,of General Counsel,that the governor,doesn't get involved.,In any of the parole instances,,he turns it over,to the parole board.,Think about that concept.,These are unelected people,that are on the board.,They're just regular people,and they're appointed,by the governor.,And you as the governor,of the state of Michigan,that get elected by the citizens,you're going to say,,""Oh, what do you want me to do?"",The parole board says,they shouldn't do anything."",That's crazy.,[Kevin] I think people,in Michigan,are finally realizing,that this story,is not going away,and it's not staying local.,It's going to get bigger.,It's going to get national.,It's gonna get international.,And someone's gonna,have to answer,as to why Rick Wershe,is still in prison,because nobody,has answered for that yet.,This is the Claus von Bülow case,uh, that, uh,,I was the appellant lawyer.,And you don't get too many cases,where the reversal,of the conviction,makes the front page,of the New York Times.,[Kevin] Attorney Alan Dershowitz,has an office full of memories,from the big cases.,OJ Simpson, Mike Tyson,,Patty Hearst, Jim Baker.,He can't see any reason,Rick Wershe should still,be behind bars.,[Alan] This is a terrible,,terrible injustice.,This sentence has,so many constitutional problems,that one would hope,a court would look at it,very skeptically.,[Alan] One might,at least have the hope,that they will see,the thing in context,,and say to themselves,,""Oh, my God.,Young man, drug offense.,Look at how much time he spent.,That doesn't make sense."",Alan Dershowitz,has agreed to assist,Rick Wershe's attorney,,Ralph Musilli, saying,,""An injustice like this,needs as much public attention,as possible."",Who's gonna be the hero here,and do the right thing?,[Dana] I don't really think,anyone can look,at all the facts,surrounding this case,and not feel bad for him.,And whether it's appropriate,or not for me to say,,I, I am still a human being,despite being the judge,that just happened,to inherit this case.,[Dana] I can't check that,at the door,,and I think part of, uh, my job,is to have compassion,for people and the people,that come before me,,and to see all sides,of the story.,And I don't know how anyone,can look at this,and not feel bad for him.,I say Rick shoulda did,seven, eight years,and been home.,Should have been home.,20 years ago.,Even my daughters,,everybody say,,""Yeah, they should,let the boy go.,He did enough time."",Murders ain't--,He did more time than murderers.,[foreboding music],[Scott] The leader of the,Young Boys Incorporated,,Butch Jones,,the Henry Ford of heroin,as he'd like to call himself,,responsible for hundreds,and hundreds,of kilos

years,and Richard Wershe, Jr.,should be in for 28 years?,[Nate] I know I'm going to hell.,There's nothing that I could do,to change that,because my life,had so much violence,,so much everything but, yet,,White Boy Rick,is still locked up.,[Ralph] The government takes,a 14-year-old boy,out of high school,and places him in imminent peril,so that they can do their job.,[Ralph] And after,they used

Bartleby (1970) - full transcript,"Updated to 1970s London, this faithful adaptation of Herman Melville's classic follows a young accounting clerk rebelling against his employer by responding to demands to do work by saying, ""I prefer not to."" This is carried on ad absurdum until the office is in chaos because the other employees must do Bartleby's work. His boss is unable to fire or help him and eventually has him placed in a mental hospital. Paul Scofield (A Man for All Seasons), John McEnery (The Duellists) and Thorley Walters (TV's ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"") star in this impeccably mounted study of employment, insanity, and the rigors of everyday life from one of literature's most acclaimed geniuses.","(TRAIN RUMBLING),(INDISTINCT TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT),BARTLEBY:,""Name.,""Address.,""Telephone number.,""Date of birth.,""Nationality.,""Education.,""Social Security number.,""Previous employment.,""Give two references.,

For Lucio (2021) - full transcript,"This is a tribute to an artist whose songs told the story of Italy at a time of rapid social and cultural change. Thanks to the testimony of the singer's manager and friend Tobia Righi, and an effective and original use of archive material, Pietro Marcello retraces the life of Lucio Dalla, making him a spotlight through which Marcello sheds light on a country that rose from the ruins of the Second World War to sever its roots with peasant culture and move towards a future of factories, consumerism and mass car production. Not handsome or dashing like the other singers of his generation, Lucio Dalla embodied a different role model that was closer to ordinary people. For here was an artist capable of transposing the poetry of Roversi, who provided the lyrics for some of Dalla's most beautiful songs, into a musical arrangement that spoke to everyone. The director of Martin Eden returns to the documentary form with a film that pays tribute not only to a great singer but also to a notion of a people that has vanished with him.","Beppe Caschetto and Rai Cinema,present,an IBC Movie production,in collaboration with Avventurosa,with the support of,Regione Emilia-Romagna,with the support of,Regione Lazio,Regional Fund for Cinema,and Audiovisuals,in collaboration with,a film by Pietro Marcello,FOR LUCIO,Dear Tobia,,you were with Lucio for many years.,Were you always his manager?,
,
,
,No, I began in 1966,when he came into the restaurant Cesari.,And said to me,,""Tobia, I need to talk to you,because I need a manager.,Because I'm not happy,with the one I have..."",I said, ""I've never been a manager"".,""I trust you."",And then he said...,He left.,He was wearing a bike helmet.,I hadn't even recognized him.,Then he came back and said,,""Tobia, I forgot to tell you something.,I'm broke"".,
,
,
,My first concert was in Gallipoli.,I remember that,at the entrance it said,,""man"", and a price,""woman"", another price.,There were lots of people dancing,so I went to get the money.,Panic.,I went to this guy,,one of the organizers, and told him,,""Listen. Let's count the money"".,""I have no money."",""But the venue is full.,How can you say that?,You signed a contract,,I set off from Bologna,,for you to tell me,,'Good morning'? I don't think so.,We need to fix that."",So, what did I do?,I quickly stole,his and his friend's Rolexes.,Both their watches.,And then I told him,,""Tomorrow I'll be at Hotel Plaza,in Taranto."",Another Carnival party.,""If you bring the money,,I'll give back the Rolexes.,Otherwise, I'll keep them."",I'm happy to have had this night,as my debut with Lucio.,And so she was left alone,in the room,The room overlooking the port,Her only clothes what she had on,And the days shorter and shorter,And though she didn't know,his name,Or what country he was from,She awaited me like a gift of love,From that first month on,Lucio told me to go to his house.,I rang the bell and his mother,opened the door.,Lucio hadn't arrived yet,,or wasn't there,,I don't remember anymore.,His mother asked me,,""So you're Tobia, the manager?,Of what? My son's manager?,Manager of what?,He must find a job, and he must study.,He needs to stop acting like a clown.,You understand?"",As the old adage says,,'There is only one mother'.,It's true.,I remember that time with great delight.,- What is happening?,- It's a mother with a problem.,- A problem?,- Her son has a beard.,I'm so sorry. Do you want me,to make it disappear?,- I wish.,- You'd be happy?,- The happiest.,- Only the beard?,- Does he have long hair, too?,- He does.,Long hair, too!,Maybe you need a barber,rather than a magician.,I'd love that.,Look, we have a fantastic singer,we'll soon introduce,,who has a beard and long hair,and yet, he's liked by many.,- What's your name, madam?,- Dalla.,Dalla? But...,- Our singer is Dalla, too.,- So strange.,- Where are you from?,- Bologna.,He's from Bologna, too!,Where do you live?,Does he have a beard?,- He does.,- Then, it's him.,It's him!,Of course!,Lucio Dalla, here he is!,Come here, Lucio.,You don't want your son to have a beard?,But it's so nice.,She was the first who gave a beard to me.,Oh, it was you?,You could act in a film,based on the Bible.,Or on the Risorgimento.,- He vaguely resembles... who?,- Garibaldi.,Anyone from the Risorgimento era.,He sings well, though, madam.,- I like it.,- You do?,That's bad...,You must be happy, right?,- Is that good for you?,- Very good.,Alright, do you want to dedicate,a nice song to her?,It's not exactly fitting.,It's called ""When I was a soldier"".,Your mother is not exactly a soldier.,It fits well with today's theme: silence.,Madam, you will be escorted...,Lucio was called by Zecchino d'Oro,to sing a song.,And he brought his mother.,He always used to invite his mother,,but she'd never go because,,and I think she was right,,she'd say, ""I don't want to embarrass,him while he's working.,There will be other occasions"".,And that was an occasion,because it wasn't a concert,,just one song.,That was the first time,I saw Lucio with his mother,at the Antoniano.,And I remember a detail.,She slipped.,It was also shown on TV.,And then, the camera panned away,and she was helped up.,Everything went well.,It was a lovely night.,His mother would make him the clothes,and the purses he used.,She'd make a lot of things,,and, to Lucio, she was very important.,Family first.,His father died when he was six.,All his affection went to his mother.,His mother would always,stand by him even though...,initially, she changed,her mind later on,,initially she was like,any other mother at that time.,They were obsessed with finding,a stable job for their children.,But that wasn't a stable job.,The director of this program,decided to compare some of the candidates,who came for the audition,,and who weren't always well-prepared,,with personalities,who have had a great success,which is still current and valid.,One of them is Lucio Dalla.,Hello.,I'm very glad to have you as our guest.,Because you're one of the few people,with a very solid musical background.,You have a top-notch jazz background.,Yes, I started out as a clarinet player.,Initially as an amateur,and then as a professional.,Where did you use to play?,My first band was based in Bologna,,it was called the Reno Jazz Gang.,Then, I moved to Rome,and played with the Second Roman,New Orleans for two years,,as a clarinettist.,I didn't sing back then.,It wasn't in my plans.,I see. How come you left,the jazz scene?,A big reason was that,it wasn't economically viable.,I literally needed to eat.,I was 17 or 18 in a city,that wasn't my hometown.,I would often starve,and sleep on the streets.,I think I was a predecessor,of the hippie culture,because I had no place to sleep.,But the main reason,was that I had already noticed,,and lately even more so,,that there was a large gap,between the music I used to make,and the recipient of my music:,the audience.,After all, jazz is a biologically,unknown language.,It's a type of music that we,can only perceive intellectually.,We can love it,,but we can't understand it.,- We can't make it ours.,- We can't transfer it.,Jazz is the technical background,that I use to express myself,and make music,that is not underground,and that deals with issues,that are Mediterranean,,- almost folkloric.,- I see.,Day after day,Sun after sun,I've never reckoned,How far I've walked,When I look around,I don't realize,Whether I'm in Rome,Or a foreigner, I am here,I watch the river and the city,I watch the water,,and watch within me,Everything is rushing forward,but where does it go?,The river, the ocean,,then I don't know,Roads and alleys,,then I don't know,One always leaves,but never arrives,Never,I followed a shadow,But it was my own,Like a challenge,It was always ahead of me,On the long journey,The faces I saw,I now realize,All look like me,Lucio always did what he felt like doing.,And I must say, he was right.,Because when I started,there were many people,who didn't believe in him.,Many would say,,""What do you think you're doing,,following Lucio and all that..."",And yet...,Tobia won.,Lucio tried everything.,He wanted to do everything.,And this is good.,We all endured poverty,,but he would ease that for everyone.,Even when he was broke.,What do you want from life?,Honestly, I don't know yet.,I mean, I do, but it's hard to explain.,I want many things. I want tranquillity.,I want to live problem-free.,I want to get along with everyone,but at the same time,,I don't want all those things.,How can you achieve all this?,Surely, not by living how I'm living now.,With some effort, I think.,Is your job hindering,the fulfilment of your dreams?,Yes, absolutely.,But it also gives me great things,,like contact with people,which is the best part.,Being able to talk to a stranger,,someone who comes to me,and asks, ""How are you?"",To initiate a conversation,,it's important to me.,If you weren't a singer,,what would you be?,A house painter.,Why?,Just 'cause.

No,The mouth was silent,Lucio had a dear friend whom, sadly,,I need to mention.,He was always,with Renzo Cremonini.,A very delightful person.,Crucial in Lucio's life.,He was his producer, along with others.,You know how it is in the music world.,One makes a song and becomes,producer of that song.,I must say something,very important about Cremonini.,I don't know if many people know this.,He's the one who introduced,Roversi to Lucio.,If the mountains were all sowed,with grain,If packs of horses,returned to the plains,Flying through the flowers,and the grasses,As I told my tales of love,I would still be just twenty,As the geese fly on,But the snow is falling on my hands,And my horse is far away by now,Night and fog are in its eyes,My weapon lies across my knees,My bow and arrow unused,As the geese fly on,Where the river meets the sea,The water is a race of light,Flood me with a single smile,If the mountains are all forest,And the streets whipped by tempests,I will stop my flight,I can tell the tale of my past life,And will be able to wait for you,As the geese fly on,Roversi wasn't a socialite.,He'd stay home,and would send the lyrics.,I think he didn't want to be involved,in the music industry.,He was...,I can describe him like the type...,His life was his brain.,I've always said that.,He had everything in there.,He'd articulate beautifully.,As long as you didn't talk,about money to him.,You'd suggest some lyrics to him,,""This song here, what if we wrote,lyrics everyone can understand?,You know, we could..."",Ambiguity in lyrics?,Roversi wouldn't fall for that.,You'd ask him for some lyrics,,he'd write them,,and that was that.,Then it was up to you, through music,,to turn it into a masterpiece.,He's left a strong impression on me.,However,,we weren't very close.,Being close to Roversi wasn't easy,because he was a taciturn man,,he kept to himself,,he didn't want to disturb anyone.,I would often see him,in one of Via Marconi's,side streets in Bologna,,waiting for the bus.,I'd stop and ask him,,""Roberto, are you going anywhere?,Do you want me to drive you?"",He would always turn me down.,He was always with his wife.,He was a person...,Just talking about him now, I feel like...,There are no longer,any men like him.,Roberto Roversi, you were born,in Bologna in 1923.,Compared to the city,of your childhood,,what has changed,in present-day Bologna?,Surely many things,,but what do you think,is the most striking change?,The Bologna of my childhood,was a rural town,,at the head of a rural culture,and society.,Now, this society has gone.,It was rapidly destroyed,in a terrifying cultural genocide,in the 1950s,,and it hasn't been replaced,with anything equally,whole and stimulating.,The Bologna of my childhood,had sounds, smells, noises,typical of the countryside.,There were scents.,You could track the business seasons,through the scents in the air.,The hemp season,,the grape harvest,,the time when the people,would store the castellata,,which was an established,amount of grapes, in the cellar,stored in a special barrel,that was carried by oxen,from the countryside to the city.,Now, that bond,with the territory,,with the smells, is gone.,Bologna has become,a regular, post-industrial city.,Or better, a downright,industrial city of our times.,Tobia, who was Roversi for Lucio?,Roversi was everything.,Thanks to his collaboration with Roversi,,Lucio learned to write songs.,Dear Roberto,,it's 4 am and I've finished the album.,You taught me everything:,to be respectful,and strong at the same time.,Roversi was a fine intellectual.,He was incorruptible.,He had his beliefs.,Right or wrong,,it's not up to me to judge.,I admired him for this.,For his positions.,And because he didn't do,things for money.,The Mille Miglia,was the greatest open-road race,of all times.,It took place in Italy,between 1927 and 1957.,The Mille Miglia was born,to demonstrate the legitimacy of cars.,It became,the major advertising medium,in a transformation process,that rapidly changed,the country's reality.,Rural Italy was painfully losing,its social and cultural identity.,The last cars left,Before the glow of dawn,The air full of dust,and burning rubber from the tires,All of Italy is awake,In Bologna, Arcangeli is in the lead,In Rome, it's Nuvolari,Arcangeli has engine problems,And behind the barriers,the crowd goes wild,The Alfas are in first,and second place in Rome.,In Terni they refuel,Varzi leaves Nuvola in second place,The dust is so thick in the air,You can barely make out the ferocious race,Over Radicofani it looks like lightning,In the halls of an ancient castle,Three hundred curves,and death seems near,With the stench of fuel,and burning tires,Clear the way.,On the second pass,of the road to Bologna,Varzi's Alfa is still ahead,But fierce Nuvolari,is gunning behind him,Flashing his lights,to get out of his way,Now Nuvola is savoring his win,With dazzling Varzi number two,Arcangeli and Campari both withdrew,All champions famous the world over,In Rome, the crowd awaits,while the battle for victory,is about to start.,That's Ingrid Bergman,waiting for Rossellini.,It was an epic race,The Mille Miglia of 1947,Over lush green Umbria,Gesu's ribcage filthy from love,It was the roughest,Most heart-pounding ever,Part symphony, part crucifixion,A wild adventure in rain and fear,A real massacre, an ancient rite,Houses and ruins, a wild tempest,Nuvolari, you're a black cloud,In a clear sky,Destroyer of the spring,As you swing your hammer,challenging fate,But if it's death you are after,It's not you who will die,Flying man of Mantova,White hot from the speed,Driving a Cisitalia 1100,Not caring if he lives or dies,You're a little Buster Keaton,racing for victory,Trees fell like dominoes,as the cars flew by,All Italy's blood pressure,through the roof,As the champions,entered the straightaway,Like a flash of lightning,too fast to see,Nuvolari, you are a white cloud now,Destroyer of the spring,in the pristine sky,Openly defying fate,But if it's death you're after,It's not you who will die,In an open car,Like a harpooned dolphin,The steering wheel,worn through the veneer,He flies through Bologna,Like a silent gale,The crowd holds its breath,Nuvolari and Carena,finish second in Brescia,Two minutes behind Biondetti,who takes first,Dirty as a dog,Speeding barefaced,Like an arrow,through the Po Valley,Tobia, what do you miss most,about Lucio?,Everything.,I miss the person I shared,forty-six years of my life with.,I had great fun.,Through him, I received, maybe,more than I deserved.,That's life.,Today, dear Stefano,,is a good day for me.,Because rarely, in our lives,,you and I have shared,a meal together.,- Never just the two of us.,- Never just the two of us.,I came here,because you're the only one,who can remember Lucio's past,even better than I can.,And this makes me very happy.,Because I've never said a thing,about ""the spider"".,- No, it's not that.,- Who nicknamed him ""Spider""?,- I did.,- Why?,But he renamed me ""Bonkers"".,- I remember.,- Because, for Lucio,,if you do,ordinary things, you're crazy.,And so he called me

Sounded like a fight.,And he heard the boy yell,out: ""I'm going to kill you"",A second later the body hit the floor,,he run to his apartment door, looked out,,saw the kid running down the,stairs and out of the house.,He called the police and they found,the father with a knife in his chest.,- And the coroner fixed the,time of death around midnight.,He's right.

If you don't,have a motive you don't have a case, right?,So anyway, that testimony from those people,across the hall from the kid's apartment,,well, that's why that was so important,,cause didn't they say that the,father 'n' the kid had an argument,and the kid run out,sometime around 7 o'clock,that night, I could be,wrong about the time...,It was 8 o'clock.,Yes, that's right, it was 8 o'clock.,They heard the argument but they,couldn't tell what the argument was about.,Then they heard the,father hit the son twice,and then later they saw the son,walk out of the apartment angrily,...but what does it prove?,It don't exactly prove anything, I'm just,saying it's part of the picture, that's all.,Yeah, but you did say it revealed the,motive and that's what the prosecution said.,To me it's a very weak motive!,This boy has been hit so many times that,violence is a normal part of his life.,I don't think a couple more hits in,the face would provoke him to murder.,It may have been two hits too,many. Everyone has a breaking point.,- Anything else?,- No.,- How about the next gentleman?,- Me?,I don't know...,I mean it's practically all,been said already, you know?,I mean we could talk about it forever.,This kid's 0 for five.

Everybody said that.,This is a real fine boy.,Ever since he was 5 years,old, his father beat him up,and he used his fists.,So would I. A kid like that?,Wouldn't you call those beatings a,motive for him to kill his father?,I'd say it's a motive for him to,be an angry young man, I'd say that.,These kids, the way they are nowadays.,They're angry, hostile.,I mean, look at the way they talk.,When I was at his age I called,my father ""Sir"", that's right!,Ever hear a boy call,his father that anymore?,Fathers don't seem to think,that's important anymore.,- No? You got any kid?,- Two.,I got one.,He is 32.,We did everything in the world,for that boy that could happen.,When he was 9 he run away from a fight,,I saw him do it, I was so,ashamed I almost threw up.,And I said to him right straight out,,I said ""I'm gonna make a man out of you,or I'm gonna bust you in half trying"".,I made a man out of him alright.,When he was 16 we got into a battle,,he hit me in the face, big kid, ya know.,I haven't seen him in 14 years.,Rotten kid!,You work your heart out...,Well come on, let's get on with it.,I think... I think we're,missing the point here.,This boy, let's say he's a,product of a filthy neighborhood,and a broken home, he can't help it,,we're here to decide whether,he's guilty or innocent of murder,,not to go into reasons,why he grew up this way.,He was born in a slum.,Slums are breeding grounds for criminals,,I know as a view it's no secret.,Slum big grounds are,potential menaces to society.,You can say that again!,Alright, kids who crawl out of these,places they're nothing but trash.,Hey, I don't want a think in the,world to do with them, I'm telling you.,I lived in a slum all my life!,I nursed that trash in Harlem,hospital six nights a week.,Hey, now, come on!,I used to play in a backyard that was full,of garbage, maybe it still smells on me!,Now, come on, why you got to go there...,- Let's be reasonable, there's nothing,personal... - There is something personal!,Now, now, let's not be so sensitive.,This kind of sensitivity I understand.,Alright, let's stop all this,arguing, it's just wasting time.,Now, it's your turn, let's go.,Me?

Look,,when these guys don't ask questions,,it's because they know the answer and they,figure that they'll probably get hurt by it.,Yeah, but it could also mean that the,lawyer is just plain stupid, couldn't it?,Sounds like you've,met my brother in law.,Anyway... I put myself,in the boy's place.,If I was that boy, I would've,asked for another lawyer.,I mean, if I'm on trial for my life,I would want my lawyer to,take all of the prosecution's,witnesses and just tear,them to shreds, or try.,Now look, there was one,eye witness to this killing,and someone else said,that they heard it and then,saw the boy running out later.,There was a lot of,circumstantial evidence,,but those two witnesses where the,entire case for the prosecution.,Suppose they were wrong!,What do you mean suppose they were wrong?,What's the point of having witnesses at all?,Could they be wrong?,They took the stand under oath!,What are you trying to say?,Well, they're people.,People make mistakes.,Could they be wrong?,No, I don't think so.,Do you know so?,Nobody could know something like,that.

The Burning Sea (2021) - full transcript,"In 1969, the Norwegian government announces their discovery of one of the world's largest oil fields in the neighboring North Sea, launching a prosperous period of offshore drilling. 50 years later, the environmental consequences begin to manifest - a crack has opened on the ocean floor, causing a rig to collapse. A team of researchers, including submarine operator Sofia, rushes in to search for the missing and assess the cause of the damage, but what they discover is that this is just the start of a possible apocalyptic catastrophe. As rigs are evacuated, Sofia's loving companion Stian becomes trapped in the depths of the sea, and Sofia must dive in to rescue him. THE BURNING SEA is the latest disaster epic from the team behind Skjelvet (2018) and Bølgen (2015).","I started working in the North Sea,when I was 18.

Steinar Skagemo.,Thank you for coming here,on such short notice.,There has been a dramatic development,the last couple of days. William.,The number of fractures and,slides has risen.,The platform that sank has been,looked into.,We have received video that,shows a fracture that's larger -,- than we've ever seen before.,A lot larger. If you look here...,If this is the middle of the fracture,,where the extension is greatest, -,- this means that we're talking about,a tear that is several kilometers wide.,- Perhaps several miles,- Where is this tear originating?,Oddvar?,These are the platforms in the North Sea.,This is Storegga.,About 8000 years ago this was the site of,a gigantic slide, the Storegga slide.,5000 cubic kilometers of rock,,mud and sand displaced.,The slides we've now registered,are directly in line with Storegga.,And?,We have long believed that,it was a local subsidence.,We no longer believe that.,If you will review this video...,- What are we looking at?,- A part of a larger slide.,Looking here, you can,see the sea-bed disappearing.,The Storegga slide.,It has started moving again.,- What kind of magnitude are we talking?,- Unfortunately hard to say.,But it could become greater than,anything recorded in modern times.,- In an area packed with oil rigs?,- And people, yeah.,- Why is this happening now?,- We don't know.,Could be a lot of reasons.,Climate changes or other factors.,Could even be that we,caused this ourselves.,- What is that supposed to mean?,- We have drilled thousands of wells.,Drained enormous oil- and,gas reservoirs below the seabed.,Punched a lot of holes,in that swiss cheese.,- Let's consider the situation we are facing.,- We'd love to. What do you suggest?,Stop all work in the area.,Close and secure all wells,until we know more.,If we can't close the wells,,what will happen?,Look, Skagemo.,That is the casing.,It is a sort of holster.,It's secured in the seabed,,and the drill goes into it.,If the rig capsizes,and pulls the drill out like this, -,- the oil will be freely flowing.,But what kind of magnitude would the spill be?,- Do you remember Deepwater Horizon?,- Yes.,That was the size of Denmark, and,that was one well. Here there are 350.,We are facing an enormous task.,Nobody have experienced something similar.,Nobody have practiced something similar.,The Joint Rescue Centre,will coordinate all evacuation, -,- and it is our task to secure,and shut down half the North Sea.,In order to be able to do this, -,- closing down all wells,and secure all installations, -,- demands that everybody,do their very best.,We are short on time, but no,panic. Safety is foremost.,All platforms that are on the red list,,should be secured and closed down.,- What's happening?,- I don't know any more than you.,There's a lot of people evacuating.,Renate, would you check that?,I haven't received any more information,,but we'll handle it nice and slowly.,Who owns that belt?,Ok, put it in one of the boxes.,Which remain?,Status of Statfjord A?,- Starting shutdown of Statfjord A.,- That is good.,Ok.

Terje Hamar?,Henning Sirnes?,And Eva Fjørtoft?,- Good. Follow Renate up on deck.,- Come along.,Find out who it is, and,send the information to me.,- Valve at Troll, any solution?,- Troll A? It is green.,Troll is closed.,- Moving on down the list.,- All of Statfjord is green.,This is P4 news with a news broadcast.,Unconfirmed sources report of -,- a major evacuation from,oil rigs in the North Sea.,We have not received any,confirmation from the industry.,Over to the Joint Rescue Centre,at Sola.

The Ghosts of Borley Rectory (2021) - full transcript,Harry Price investigates the ghosts of Borley Rectory during his stay there.,"So, how long do you have,Borley for, Mr. Price?,Six months.,That should be sufficient,time for me to conclude,my investigations,at put the mystery,of Borley Rectory to bed.,Now, much work to be done.,The Glanvilles will,be here in the morning,and I want the rectory,fully operational.,So, no experiments,tonight then?,Well, of course, dear boy.,From this moment on, the,investigation commences.,
,
,
,- Are we set?,- Yes.,We have everything set for the,first night as you requested.,- Trip devices?,- Set.,- Camera rigs?,- Yes, everything.,Hm, I chose wisely,from all the candidates.,I'm here to learn.,Have you learned enough,to get a good drink going?,Here you go, a,nice cup of tea.,Oh, no.,I meant a real drink.,Notebook, pencil,,lantern, watch.,Yes, I have everything.,I'm ready.,Good.,
,
,
,You're not changing for bed?,Remember, the rectory,can be very cunning.,To be prepared is best.,Oh, don't worry.,She will be kind on,your first night.,Now, go to the washroom and,remember, one hour in each room.,Wake me at 4:00 a.m..,An hour in each room.,Well, I'm not spending,one second in this room.,I'm sorry, Mr. Price.,- Harry!,- Sidney.,Harry, this is my daughter,,Helen, and my son, Roger.,Well, a pleasure to meet you.,Pleased to meet,you, Mr. Price.,I must say, father,speaks of you often.,Only good things I hope.,Did you drive up in,that Aston you have?,No, no, we took the train up.,The Aston has a broken gear box.,We took a taxi from the station,,but the old bugger made us,walk the last half mile.,Said this place is cursed.,Yes, the locals do take a,little while to get used to.,Come on, Helen.,Mr. Price, would you mind,if I take a look around?,No, of course not.,But do stay inside the grounds.,I'm sorry, I didn't,mean to startle you.,It would seem that it's in,here that most of the energy,in previous events,have been focused.,Any reasons do you think?,I wish I could give you even,an estimated guess, dear boy.,This building's extraordinary.,It practically,drips with history.,Indeed it does.,Just like his nose.,As you can see, my,son is rather astute,at this sort of thing.,Indeed he is.,Will you be going,back to London?,Yeah, sorry, old,chap, I have to.,But I thought I'd bring Helen,and Roger up and settle 'em in,and then I'll be off later.,Might even have time to catch,sight of the blasted ghost.,I'll put them both to work.,Well, I'm sure with Helen,,Roger and Mark helping you,,you'll soon find what,you're looking for.,Did somebody call my name?,Ah, Mark.,Ah, and you found,my daughter as well.,Jolly good.,How long have you got?,Sorry, old boy, I need,to travel back tonight.,You will look after,Helen and Roger for me?,You need to look after,Roger a little more.,He has a weak, you know.,Don't worry, old chap,,they're in safe hands.,And they'll learn a,lot under my tuition.,Excellent.,Well, I'm sorry our little,luncheon wasn't more elegant,,but this all we,could put together,for you at such short notice.,Being here on previous occasions,,we didn't have the time,or the resources to make,more adequate investigations.,But now, we have the,opportunity to expand,our psychical research and,discover the missing evidence,that one needs to make,the best conclusions.,Well, I must admit,as long as I remember,,Borley has been the,source of many a story.,Indeed, and I think,it's absolutely vital,that we get to the bottom,of it once and for all.,A great many people have,spoken about this place.,Indeed, it is well documented.,Many witnesses, many,different incidents.,Yes, Charles?,After all these years,,what do you hope to,achieve from this?,I mean, you yourself,have conducted extensive,paranormal experiments with,nothing to show for it.,Charles, there is so,much more to be done.,Sciences have progressed,since Lionel and Marianne,first brought this,place to my attention.,Yes, but after,all these years,,not one piece of credible,evidence has been confirmed.,Now, Charles, you know,that statement to be untrue.,We have many catalogued,pieces of evidence.,- Yeah but-,- And we have new, exciting,experiments to conduct.,I can assure you, we will get,to the bottom of his matter.,And what new experiments?,I for one am intrigued.,Yes, do tell.,It's true, I did previously,invite you to investigate,Borley Rectory some years,ago, but I told you then,,the rectory is not haunted.,I disagree.,I've owned land here and my,family have for over 100 years,,going back to the Bull family.,And they tell tales of,hauntings, apparitions,,terrible sounds,,screams in the night.,They,are merely tales.,There's no substance,to them at all.,They be convincing.,Myself and my wife,have heard things,,seen things, terrible things.,My livestock will not lay,near this end of the field.,- They know-,- Look, can we get back,to the question in hand?,Now, Mr. Price, what,is different now?,What can you do now that,we couldn't do before?,I have been given,a six month tenancy.,Well, this is an unprecedented,opportunity to investigate.,Mr. Glanville and I,have created a plan,,a rotor of investigations.,Not one single minute will go,undocumented in this period.,One of my team will,always be awake to record,,interpret and analyse.,In fact, three of,my team are working,in this building right now.,There's so many more mysteries,here to be discovered.,With round the clock,investigations,,we can understand or attribute,some of these strange,paranormal happenings to the,normal and not the abnormal.,We have some new,untested experiments,that I myself will undertake.,And nothing too,dangerous I hope?,Well, everything that,planned has been previously,tested in the,laboratory, but well,,now's the time to test these,new methods on location,,here at Borley.,Nothing too dangerous,,nothing too fantastical,,I assure you.,I reiterate, the,rectory is not haunted,and never has been.,It is haunted and,you know it, Lionel.,What worries me is that,we turn Borley Village,into a playground,for the paranormal.,A tourist attraction.,Yes, that just wouldn't do.,Imagine it, London folk,arriving for day trips.,Picnicking in the garden.,Yes, well, that,would never happen.,Everything we plan will be,conducted by scientific minds.,Nothing we discover will,be released to the press.,You said that last,time, Mr. Price.,I for one, don't want any,day trippers on my land.,This is a hamlet, it,should stay that way.,And it will.,That is why Charles,Sutton is the only person,who will be allowed to,report on what we discover.,I trust his judgement,to be balanced.,I don't want a,circus here either.,It would interrupt,with my investigations,,hamper any scientific,conclusions.,I will of course keep,these things secret.,In the knowledge,that I will have,exclusive use of,any discoveries.,Why are you lying, Lionel?,Marianne, I have,said my piece.,He's lying.,About what, Mrs. Foyster?,When he tells you that,Borley is not haunted.,We can discuss this matter,at a more convenient,time, Marianne.,No, we can discuss this now.,'Tis why we're here,,to unravel the truth.,Mrs. Foyster, is,there more to tell?,Yet more happenings that you've,kept close to your heart?,There is so much more.,We agreed not to disclose,any of this, Marianne.,No, you instructed me not to.,Now that Mr. Price has,explained his intentions,,I feel now is the time to reveal,everything that happened here.,Everything.,There is nothing to disclose.,You're lying.,Either you tell them or I will.,This could be interesting.,Ah, we love a scandal.,What better than,a paranormal one?,This is not,humour, Mr. Sutton.,Is there something,in this, Mr. Foyster.,Very well.,I have experienced many,inexplicable events here.,What have you experienced?,Something so frightening,,I've hidden it away,for many years.,I also instructed Marianne and,our servants never to speak,of anything they saw, heard,or encountered here at Borley.,I'm truly sorry for this.,But I'm certain my friend,,the Reverend Henning,,will reassure me that,it was what was needed,to maintain any,sanity if our lives.,To accepted what happened,to me, to Marianne,,was a way to the asylum.,To ignore it, a way to carry on.,For once, my husband,accepts his responsibilities.,I respect him for,listening to my pleas.,Thank you, Lionel.,I will reveal my story,,my paranormal events,to Mr. Price, but to him only.,Well, this I welcome.,Well, I believe that,concludes our matter.,I must, however, reveal,something to this table.,- Marianne.,- Sit down, Mr. Price.,The stories are true.,I have seen her in the house,and grounds on many occasion.,Her entity is all consuming.,She places visions in your mind.,Terrible, evil images.,I must warn you and,your team, Mr. Price.,She knows I am here,and she is smiling.,She's smiling because she has,you all alone for six months,in her playground.,She is here.,Where?,She's been listening,from the beginning.,- Is she in this room?,- She's behind you.,Can you see her?,I cannot see her.,Where is she?,Be brave.,Well, Harry Price, here I am.,Finally, you have,me in your hands.,Do you believe in,ghosts, Mr. Foyster?,I have always believed.,So, why wait so,long to embrace it?,Because I am a man of God.,My mission is solely the,care of my parishioners.,Mostly humble, God fearing folk.,Their faith is what,holds them together.,I would undermine every,funeral I minister,if I gave credence to,another form of afterlife.,To tell them that,their loved ones,might still be amongst,them even after death?,Yes.,I know that,whatever is present,inside these walls,is a lost soul.,There is a pattern to it.,- They're in a loop.,- Well, yes.,So, you have seen many?,I have.,Mostly they are shadows,,memories of what once was here.,I agree.,But there is one,,she has no pattern.,She decides when,to show herself.,This is the one I search for.,Marianne has seen,her many times.,For me, it was just the once.,But that one time was the,most frightening thing,I have ever seen,before or since.,And since that day, I,have never seen her again.,Until just now.,Today?,With all certainty, what,I saw standing behind you,was what I witnessed in 1925.,Still searching for,the truth, Mr. Price?,Yes.,Yes, I am.,I am determined to,know everything.,And now, I must say thank you.,You will return with the,others in six months time?,It will be an honour.,Miss Estelle Roberts comes,to us not for the many reasons,I have continually requested.,As I explained in our,previous correspondences,,I have no reason to be,subjected to a series,of Mr. Price's experiments only,to confirm my own abilities.,Our psychical research could,only confirm her ability.,To be a creature,in your laboratory,is something I least desire.,Scrutinising so-called,psychical powers,is a key part of our work.,We use factual science with,true meanings being achieved.,I for one, know of your,very well, Miss Roberts.,Royal Albert Hall, 1930.,You managed to bring forth,Arthur Conan Doyle's spirit.,Ah, you were there.,I was.,Sadly, I could not attend,,but my father was,most impressed.,Please, allow me a little time,and my team could,organise a test right now.,Mr. Price, my,reasons for being here,have not changed in the least.,I'm here for Borley Rectory.,It has called to me.,I sense it too.,An energy all around us.,Mark and Helen, let us,not forget that we are here,for scientific facts,,not whimsical thoughts.,When the mind starts,thinking the way you two are,,it can get carried,away with itself,and see things it wants to.,I'm sorry, Mr. Price.,Do not apologise.,Mr. Price is not,entirely factual.,Right, shall we begin?,I call to the spirits,of Borley Rectory.,Come forward and communicate.,We are here to help you.,Please, come forward.,Use our energies.,Use our bodies,for your energies.,We are here to help you.,Please come and talk to us.,I know you are there,,hiding away, just watching.,Now is the time to come forward,and make yourself known to us.,Someone is here.,I sense somebody too.,Come closer.,We know you are here.,I see a woman.,She is crying,,whimpering in the corner.,Come forward, I,cannot see your face.,Move forward.,You seem friendly.,Come and communicate.,We are not here to harm you.,And do you see it?,She's behind Mark.,I do not see it.,Please refrain,from calling her it.,I cannot see her,,but I feel her here.,Is she still behind me?,She's turning to face me.,Oh, she is scared.,She is afraid.,What is she afraid of?,Do you have a name?,What is your name, my dear?,Marie is her name.,She's there.,Is she the only one?,She's just a child in mind.,Ask if she's,the one that haunts us.,- Is she the only one who-,- She heard you.,Wait, she is not,the only one here,,but she is the original.,- We should end this now.,- No, don't break the circle.,Something is all around her.,It's an energy,,it's all consuming.,Does it have a name?,You don't understand.,It is not a person.,It is an ancient energy.,I am feeling very uncomfortable.,We need to end this now.,It's the negative energy.,It's trying to strangle me.,- We must stop.,- No!,This is the science,I am seeking.,I am trying to break,free, but it won't let me.,Very well, break the circle.,Is she gone?,I didn't mean to startle you.,You be all right?,I'm now at peace,,but thank you.,It be early.,It's surprising to,see someone here.,- I thought maybe-,- You thought I was her?,The nun who haunts here.,Yeah.,Wow, strange things,go on around here.,Lights and sounds.,You spent the night here?,I didn't sleep, but I,couldn't stay a minute longer.,First train ain't,for another hour.,My name is Estelle Roberts,,I'm a spiritualist medium.,Basil Payne, I own all,the land back of the lawn.,I'd shake your hand, but I've,been tending to my animals.,Have you seen her?,Oh, I know who,you are talking of.,I haven't, but I've seen plenty,of other strange happenings.,My family have lived,around here for years.,They tell tales.,I prefer to stay away.,What's the rectory's,business stays there.,Oh, I agree.,It was a place of,great joy once,,but now a dark,force surrounds it.,Take my advice and you,never come back here.,You leave it be.,I will take your advice.,So, you've experienced your,first week at Borley Rectory.,Seen the highs and the lows.,Was it what you all expected?,For me, a little,disappointing.,It has been,interesting, but I-,- For me, it has not lived,up to its expectations.,Good.,Then there was the,Estelle Roberts seance,,which I didn't witness.,Somebody must be on,visual 24 hours a day.,We might miss an,important event.,I did, the seance.,Miss Roberts has the,ability to project things,into susceptible minds.,It did seem real to me,,but I'm interested in doing,my own seances, so when,will that happen, Mr. Price?,All in good time.,I wish to explore more.,We look at your rigid,blue book each night.,Yes, well we must,conduct our investigations,with rigid purpose.,We must be meticulous,in our investigation.,A time will come when we,can't do all of these.,I for one, feel like we,are achieving anything.,That's what the rectory wants.,It wants you to give up.,But we all want,to experience something.,- Anything.,- And you will!,Then put our minds at rest.,You have spent periods of,time here at the rectory,,what we have seen,and heard is minimal.,Yes, how can we be so,sure that the rectory,is the most haunted,house in all of England?,What have you experienced?,Burning.,The smell of burning.,When I previously,visited Borley,,I slept in a room at,the rear of the house.,It was a small bedroom,,not much light.,I sometimes considered whether,I was being forced,to sleep there.,But this story,begins before that.,And to truly,understand my passion,,you must first know,my reasonings for it.,We are all ears, Mr. Price.,For as long as I can,remember when I was a child,,I was always overwhelmed,by the sensation,that I could smell burning.,It was my recurring nightmare.,Night terrors my,family would call it.,Like a bonfire, sometimes,it would be stronger,,other times hardly there.,I'd grown accustomed,to the smell.,Even forgotten all about it.,At least once a week until,it came time for me to leave,the family home to,go to university.,I was saying my goodbyes to,everyone and when I spoke,to my mother, I asked her to,finally air my bloody room out.,I think she misunderstood,at first, until I elaborated,and explained about the smell,in my childhood nightmares.,Her face went very,pale, unnaturally so.,Like a wave had gone over it.,And almost as quickly,as it came, it passed.,She smiled, wished me the,best, I left for university.,It was at university that,my mind kept returning,to this exchange, to how my,mother looked in that moment.,And it began to,pull at a thread.,Well, the house I was,raised in was a normal home,with its own history.,Unremarkable, you might say.,Except for one thing, one,tragedy my mother told me.,An old woman had lived,there in the 1700s.,She was known to be,something of a miser, unkind.,And keen to say we she could,,she would only ever light,the fire in the smallest,room of the house.,Well, they were unsure,how it happened,,but there was a freak accident.,A relative found her,,burned to death in the room.,My room.,Now, you may say that it,was all just a coincidence,,and yet the funny thing is, I,only ever had the nightmares,while I was in my family home.,While I was at university, I,never once had a night terror.,Bloody hell.,I used stronger words,than that, I can tell you.,And it was at that point that,I knew what I wanted to do.,I wanted to solve mysteries.,Well, you wanted the,reasonings behind Harry Price.,And there it is.,But do you want to,know the real mystery?,Tell me why after,years of no nightmares,,how it is that I should,experience that same sensation,,the smell of burning on the,very first night I slept,in that back room here,at Borley Rectory.,Good night.,It was 1931, in the,previous few years,,Marianne had had,a few interesting,paranormal events happen to her.,Looking to do simple tasks,because the maid was away,for the weekend, Marianne,found herself in a part,of the rectory that she,didn't usually visit.,She's frozen in that moment.,Hesitant to turn around,because she knows at that time,she is alone in the rectory.,And as she turns,,she is terrified.,She she's a nun-like figure,and she is frozen with fear.,An overwhelming sense of,helplessness comes over her.,Marianne sinks to her knees.,She is in pain.,She senses a figure,walking towards her.,And then, Marianne looks,up and in that moment...,The nun is no more.,Hello?,- Was it you?,- Me?,Three nights in a row,,bright lights, bells ringing.,Lights?,Where's Mr. Price?,- Payne?,- Ah, there you are Mr. Price.,Three nights in a row now.,Bells from the church ringing,,intense lights from the rectory.,Mark, has anything,like this been recorded?,No, Mr. Price, nothing.,I am confused.,Please come in.,If you have witnessed a,phenomenon, then we must record it.,Are you telling me that,you haven't been doing,any extraordinary experiments?,Well, nothing,that would conclude,with what you have witnessed.,Look, come inside and,we can record this.,No, leave it be.,My animals are scared.,And now, I'm scared.,I want nothing more to,do with this rectory.,I leave it alone.,It leaves me alone.,Roger, you should've,recorded this.,Considering our situation,,I don't think there's,anything that could.,As in my eyes, I'm still unsure,if it even happened at all.,Harry wants us to,record everything.,If I must.,My brother is a,little weak sometimes.,Yes, forgive me for saying,,but he strikes me as,bit of a wet blanket.,And whether,he is even up to this.,Well, we'll just,have to wait and see,to find out then, won't we?,- Mr. Price?,- Ah, there you are.,I thought you'd,abandoned us completely.,Where's Roger?,I thought he was on shift?,He's feeling a little,under the weather.,Oh, yes.,I heard what happened.,I've sent your father a message.,Roger may have to,return to London.,I am unsure that he,has the constitution,for this kind of work.,The rectory has seen him,as the weaker one of us.,It's latched onto his fear.,I shall await your,father's instructions,,but you may have to leave,to escort Roger back home.,But I don't want to leave.,Well, it'll be,at least 24 hours,before I receive a response.,I've decided to make the best,use of the time we all have,together and move up to the,next stage of the investigation.,The simplest of,tools, my dear boy.,This simplest of tools.,Are you okay?,Are you?,Don't be foolish.,Did I scare you?,- Yes!,- Good.,Roger, where are the others?,I don't know.,But can you hear that ringing?,Oh, God.,What is it?,My hand, the air, it's cold.,Ice cold.,I want out of this place.,You're right.,Absolutely right.,The wire, it's moving.,I don't want to be,here a moment longer.,Don't worry, we,shall be leaving soon.,- What is it?,- It's moving.,It's actually moving.,She's here.,Price, no!,I, I, I, I have some matches.,Here, let me light one.,I have to leave with him.,Father couldn't,come and collect us,,and Roger is in no fit,state to travel alone.,I understand.,At least the rectory,got what it wanted.,And what is that?,You and Mr. Price to itself.,I'm sorry, dear boy.,I didn't mean to scare you.,- I thought it was-,- What did I tell you,about having thoughts?,The rectory will,get to you too soon.,Now that Roger and Helen,have both retreated,,it's just me and you.,But don't worry, I've made,arrangements for our final week.,What is next?,I think we need to,take things up a gear.,Let's get this packed,away and we'll see,what we can conjure,up before dinner.,Chop chop.,What perplexes you, Mark?,I'm really not too,sure to be honest.,I'm just grappling with my,own recollection of events.,Well, that's always,the difficulty isn't it?,That's why using a witness,can be a difficult way,to corroborate an event.,How so?,Say you meet a friend,at a train station.,You haven't seen each,other in some time.,You drink together,,you talk, you laugh,,you part company,and then you decide,to tell the next person,you see what happened.,Well, you recount the,event almost perfectly,,word for word, conversation,for conversation,,but still, small details slip.,Mistakes are made.,You're asked, what,did your friend wear?,And you think, was it a,red tie or was it a blue?,- Memory.,- Memory.,It's why note taking,,photographic proof,,these are all vital in,trying to piece together,exactly what happened.,Because,memory can be fallible.,Exactly.,At least, that's what I recall.,What is that?,I know that it is not us.,It's coming from,the blue room.,The room, it's freezing.,So it is.,Mark, feel the books.,Dear, God, Harry.,They're so cold.,It isn't the,books, it's the wall.,Help me with the bed.,The wall is ice cold.,It's reacting with,the air in the room.,It's made it damp.,There's dredger of,flour in the suitcase.,- Fetch it for me.,- Will do, what's it for?,Normally, I lay it of,the floor for footprints,,but watch.,Harry, have you taken,leave of your senses?,I have not, dear boy.,I have not.,The flour acts as,a binding agent.,Where the wall is,damp it will stick.,You try.,You see?,What is...,Get the camera.,We need to record this.,It's gone.,Indeed it has.,So, how was London?,Good, though I feel the,society need additional,information if they were,to pursue this further.,- How's young Roger?,- Better.,Poor chap wasn't up,to the challenge.,I'm glad you could come back.,Ah, may I assume you,have a few things around?,Look, I feel that we're,closer to something now.,Maybe even a breakthrough.,Breakthrough to what?,Ah, well, that's,the question isn't it?,So, what's your theory?,Well, I think this place acts,as a conduit, a connection,,a doorway for those,that pass through.,- Like a tunnel?,- Yes, if you will.,And the nun?,Hm, she is lost.,Trapped, perhaps in a,cycle, unable to escape.,Possessed by this,ancient evil energy.,Very well.,How on earth do we try,and communicate with that?,Well, I firmly believe,that this is a science.,It's just not an exact science.,But I think we can,communicate, set her free,,and give the haunting of Borley,Rectory a complete ending.,How long has it been?,Yes, yes, it has been hard,work, but we're nearly there.,I don't intend for this,continue beyond the six months.,Well, I should like to,thank you all for returning.,Sadly, Mr. Payne,declined my offer.,Your six months,turned into a year.,Yes, they did.,With the help of,Reverend Henning.,Now the time has come to sell,the rectory and with regret,,I must conclude my,investigations here.,But I'm certain the new,occupants will extend you,the same courtesy that we have.,I'm afraid not.,Captain Gregson,is the new occupant,,and he wants nothing,to do with Mr. Price.,And in his own words, ""Ghosts,are the ravings of a lunatic."",But I feel I have,achieved as much,as I could in the,last 12 months.,And until such a day science,exceeds what we have now,,well, I'm afraid this is the end,for Borley Rectory and,its investigations.,What, is that it?,But what happened?,What did you record?,You promised new evidence.,Charles, my dear boy,,what I'm about to tell you,goes way beyond evidence.,But it must never,leave this room.,- Why?,- That is my tender.,It must remain here at Borley.,Marianne, are you,quite sure you wish me,to recount this story?,Harry, please do tell.,Whatever is here can,no longer harm me.,We are listening.,On several occasions,from that point on,,Sidney, Mark and,Helen came and went.,But not a single noteworthy,paranormal event happened,in the rectory over,the next three months.,But it was just a front.,A pause in proceedings for,what was about to happen.,And it will stay with me,for the rest of my life.,I shall start, as is,customary at the beginning.,It's like the house was,asleep or just resting.,But hell was about,to wake us all.,Harry, it's okay, it's okay.,Did you see something?,Just a nightmare.,- I should record it.,- No.,Mark, it isn't noteworthy.,As you were.,Tea?,Better?,Mildly, yes.,What was it?,My own death if that could be.,Yes.,Then it's entirely,true, isn't it?,Indeed.,You wanted to communicate with,whatever it is that exists,,- I firmly believe-,- It already is communicating.,Exactly.,We need everyone.,Absolutely.,Helen is back.,And so is somebody I didn't,think I would ever see again.,Marianne.,I do hope this'll,be the very last time,you summon my presence here.,Ladies and gentlemen,,we should begin.,Firstly, I should like to thank,you for coming here today.,Often, what we do can be seen,as idealistic or,worse, hysterical.,But I think we're,neither of those.,I think we're pioneers,,on the edge of discovering,something truly incredible.,For almost 12 months now,,we've recorded and catalogued,all the different phenomena,that have happened,here at the rectory.,And I believe we are now on,the cusp of real communication.,And this seance is the last,roll of the dice, as it were.,Our last attempt at discovering,what lies beyond our world.,To find the truth and to release,the negative energy,that haunts here.,So, unless there are any,objections, let us begin.,Firstly, I would,ask for everyone,to hold hands with another.,Fingertip to fingertip.,I will of course be using,the planchette at some point,,but let us try the old way.,Good.,The reason for this is simple.,It's to ensure,that no fowl play,,as it were, is taking place.,Although, I doubt that any of,you are pranksters at heart.,Thank you, Mr. Price.,However, from this moment on,,I shall be the,only one to speak,,so the spirit knows,who to channel through.,Secondly, a medium would,usually ask for all,to keep their eyes closed,throughout this process.,However, I would like,all eyes to be open,and my eyes shall remain closed.,Let us begin.,My name is Helen Glanville.,I am joined here today with,family, friends, and colleagues.,Sidney Glanville, Mark,Kerr-Pearse, Harry Price,,and finally, Marianne Foyster,whom you may already know.,I shall knock three times.,If you can hear the knocking,,please respond with one knock.,Very well.,Again, I shall,knock three times.,If you are here, please,respond with one knock.,Mark, perhaps we should-,Oh, thank you.,Spirits, who shall,I address you as?,Spirits, I shall simply,ask you some questions.,Knock once for,yes, twice for no.,Is that clear?,Do you know this place?,Do you know the,people in this room?,Are you watching us?,Can you move on?,Are you trapped?,Are you in pain?,Is someone hurting you?,Another spirit perhaps?,The know someone else?,Is that other spirit,here in this room?,Lantern.,It was her.,The real her.,Look!,Helen.,Helen!,Harry, what is it?,This building's a conduit,filled with spirits.,But they're all scared,of the same thing.,A ghost, any old ghost?,I don't think it's a ghost.,Helen.,Helen?,Helen isn't here.,Who are you?,We are everyone.,Those who have lived.,Those who have died.,Died?,Release her!,Release my daughter!,No.,We are safe here.,We can hide.,- Hide?,- They are hiding inside her.,That's what they wanted.,Hiding from whom?,Oh, my God!,It can't,harm us, can it?,No, only the dead.,It can only harm the dead.,That was it, wasn't it?,You brought us here, you drew,us here to open the doorway,,to pass through to the,other side and hide!,Hide within my daughter.,But you can't, I won't let you!,Sidney, no.,Let us escape this torment.,We must escape this torment.,Of course.,They're trapped, unable,to move on by her.,She's feeding off them.,Feeding off their terror.,But Helen, they,can't take Helen!,But they can take me.,Mark.,Helen didn't want this.,I don't want this.,- Mark, no, you can't-,- Harry, it's fine.,- Mark, no.,- Please.,I'm sorry, Helen.,Mark!,Mr. Price?,As I said, Inspector,,it was a fall.,A fall you say?,Mighty odd.,Seems to have no,bruising at all.,And you'd conclude,this too, Mrs. Foyster?,It was a terrible accident.,The rectory is very rundown.,It's a death trap.,Hm.,To avoid suspicion, I'm,afraid we'll have to wait,until dawn before we,make our final exit.,Do you think Mark will,make a full recovery?,Yes.,He is strong.,Give him time, he,should pull through.,Remember he lived here,with me for almost a year.,I have lived,here for many more.,I have seen Mark's,condition

Lady Liberty (1971) - full transcript,"Maddalena and Michele fall in love in Italy in the 1960s, while working at a meat factory in Emilia stormed by the workers' protest, but their love can't be, because he is married and Italy has no divorce. So she persuades him to move to the U.S., and joins him four years later, bringing a Mortadella (sort of salami, processed pork anyway) as a present. But Customs do not allow processed meat to enter the U.S., so she is held at JFK airport but refuses to give in (she indeed is a very strong woman). In the meantime, she discovers the truth about Michele and a few things about the US.","Excuse me,,you must go to your seats,and put on your seat belts.,We're about to land.,Sorry, we're about to land.,THE MORTADELLA,AKA LADY LIBERTY,You smell that?,What were they smoking?,I'd better tell Bob right away.,Miss, excuse me.,We're in New York.,What?,Oh, what a pity.,
